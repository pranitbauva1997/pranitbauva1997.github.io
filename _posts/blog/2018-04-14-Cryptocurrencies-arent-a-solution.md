Cryptocurrencies were alleged started because public lost trusts in banks
and other financial institutions as a result of the subprime mortgage
crisis in 2007-08.

In the height of a lot of people trying to claim that cryptocurrencies
would change how we do banking and financial transactions, I wish to
express my personal thoughts about its limitations (as of now). Of course,
technology changes and in future, the limitations can be addressed easily.
This article addresses why banks aren't afraid of cryptocurrencies
(otherwise, they would have made a cryptocurrency of their own before most
of the people even came to know about it).

Bitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency's
[paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
describes bitcoin as:

> A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
> payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going
> through a financial institution.

As described in the paper, bitcoin does **exactly** the same thing and nothing
else.

Definition of a bank as provided by
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank):

> A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public
> and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly
> or indirectly through capital markets.

**Did you notice the remarkable difference in both the definitions?**

Wikipedia and research papers can often be obscure and a definition doesn't
really help a lot. So let me explain.

## Banks provide liquidity in capital markets

What "providing liquidity" means is that can either take money or provide
money whenever needed.

The main purpose of banks is to take public money and lend to
the needy. In return, they give the public an interest on the money
deposited as an opportunity cost and against inflation. If you have money
tied up under carpets like a Gujju or Pablo chachu, the inflation rate is
going to eat up the value of the money (but won't be your major issue if
you are Gujarati or Pablo).

## Commercial banks

[Commercial banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank)
mainly offer savings account and fixed deposit for earning
interest and current account for businesses to operate where they don't
charge any interest and neither do they charge any fees for that. With the
deposits they take, they invest it in debt which people want in the form
of mortgage, vehicle loan, and up to some extent to companies.

## Investment banks

[Investment banks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_banking)
help companies raise money through IPO or bond issues.
They also have a network of HNIs (High Net worth individuals) and
institutions who want to park money in order to generate returns. They also
act as market makers in exchanges and buy/sell assets when no one is
willing to. They help to provide a route for retail investors to invest
in public companies and charge brokerage for that.

Well, you would be now thinking that all of this can be done through
blockchain technology (not essentially cryptocurrency), right?

If yes, then you might be a blockchain developer. Kudos, but do read the
entire thing. I promise you would learn something from it and it would be
fun.

Let's talk about the origin of money, banking system and others. To read
in more detail about origins of money, read the book
["The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607-the-ascent-of-money)
by [Niall Ferguson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5790.Niall_Ferguson).

## Elizabethan Era

[This period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era)
is regarded as the "golden period" in the English history. If
you are good at history, you would remember that Shakespeare lived in this
era and if you are one of his fans, you might have read the book
["The Merchant in Venice"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice).
Lending in this era was mostly peer to peer like
Shylock gave money to Bassanio while Antonio (his friend and a wealthy
person who currently had his money parked in outside waters) would cover
it in case of default.

So to be historically precise, banking and lending were always done
peer-to-peer. But something happened where people realized the need for a
bank.

As the story of "A Merchant of Venice" unfolds, a rumour spreads out that
Antonio's ships have wrecked and thus he has lost most of his investment.
This triggers a default of the debt. I hope you see an issue over here.

Antonio was a person with an extremely good credit history but he still
defaulted because of something beyond his control. Peer-to-Peer lending
had failed because it had failed to **diversify**. What are the chances that
shipwrecks? Had Shylock given his money to a million people, the losses
would be minuscule and could be easily covered up with risk premiums in
the interest rate.

## Federal Reserve of United States

The concept of
[Federal Reverse Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank)
in the United States was borrowed from European countries in the 1910s.
What was happening is that some people with
malicious intent would declare that a bank is going to go bankrupt even
though it was actually quite healthy. No bank keeps deposited money in
lockers and pays interest on them. Instead, a major portion of the money is
invested. When all the people rushed to take their money out, the bank
would be unable to clear it's current liabilities and would go bankrupt.
The Federal bank became the liquidity provider since it could inject money
whenever it wished and give it to the bank to cover up for their short-term
liabilities. This is the current solution to the age-old banking problem.

I have presented an extremely simple model and of course this isn't quite
true. If you are interested in reading more about this please read
[this paper](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf?la=en&hash=9A8788FD44A62D8BB927123544205CE476E01654)
published by Bank of England pointed out in the comments below by Rohan.

## Subprime Mortgage Crisis

This is said to be fueled because of the extremely low interest rates
during the tenure of
[Alan GreenSpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan) since he
strongly believed in deregulation and that market is the best decider
of the price. To the blockchain folks, what this means is that a common
consensus can't always work better for themselves. When dealing with humans,
we always have to take into account the human emotions like fear and greed
otherwise, we would end up like
[Long Term Capital Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management)
and as much as smart as they were, they ended up losing money for their
investors.

There are many more such stories to include to prove why a central
regulation system is required but then this already long article would
become even longer. The book "The Ascent of Money" already describes
why
[Free Markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market)
failed to solve this issue.

As for the current state, the blockchain industry has no solution in the
near term and in fact is already showing problems.

## Dominance in Cryptocurrency market

An article in medium with the title
["Stop. Calling. Bitcoin. Decentralized"](https://medium.com/@homakov/stop-calling-bitcoin-decentralized-cb703d69dc27)
explains the concentration of
bitcoin miners. Heck, even democracy
is supposed to be decentralized where "every citizen gets an equal vote",
but we all know how rigged our system is. It's time we start accepting this fact
for cryptocurrencies as well.

## Cartels in Cryptocurrency markets

There are already many cartels in the futures market of Bitcoin operating
via CME which because of their
[leveraged position](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp#axzz1gKhHisSM)
are manipulating
cryptocurrency prices. [Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20180331133140/https://medium.com/@super.crypto1/4th-dimension-bitcoin-manipulation-cartel-can-it-be-burnt-no-way-c53de65c166a)
is a medium post explaining this.

## Your broker/exchange isn't decentralized

Many people who buy cryptocurrency from an exchange or broker don't
realize that the transaction they just did while purchasing the
asset is in fact the same old transaction. One first deposits money in
the broker/exchange's bank account. The broker then arranges for the asset
at market price and takes a commission. After the asset is bought, it can
be transferred to anyone which is decentralized. Of course, if
you have mined the cryptocurrency, then you shouldn't be worried about
this except when to try to sell it in open market.

The brokers/exchanges are unregulated private companies. Their
balance sheets are not publicly available. You might never know when
the broker/exchange might go bankrupt. They don't have to follow rules
like other national exchanges do. They don't invest enough in security
of their platform. They might be using the idle cash in your account to
buy cryptocurrency for their account, and guess what, you would never
know. How is that bad? Well, if the asset prices go down, the broker/
exchange made a loss on a trade where they didn't even have to put a
collateral, which could be a serious issue if the broker has a high
leverage. White collar crimes like
[spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoofing_(finance))
in cryptocurrency exchanges are extremely common. And did I mention
about the huge [bid ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp)
they charge? Ouch, 3-5% of the trade amount
would definitely hurt your pockets.

## High Volatility

The cryptocurrency markets at this point in time are extremely volatile.
Let's say a merchant sold some goods worth $8000 and
according to the current BTC price, the buyer paid 1 BTC. Now, the
merchant has an open position in BTC. He can either go in the market and
quickly sell it and pay the broker/exchange fees of around 3-5% or it
can carry forward the open position where he runs the risk of the currency
being devalued. If the next day, BTC prices drop to $7000, then the
merchant took a loss of $1000. Of course, if you are a [derivatives trader](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp),
you could argue that you can hedge the open position using futures and
options (one of the strategy being gamma scalping), but then think about
it again, should a simple merchant be involved in complex derivatives
transactions (and pay a hefty fee for that too)? Probably no, right?

## Economic Benefit

Remember, the 51% attack wouldn't be fruitful because the computing power
would just be wasted and bitcoin's worth will drop? Well, things just
changed thanks to the introduction of Bitcoin futures in CME. Now you
can have a short position in bitcoin, perform a 51% attack (even easier
now because of consolidation of miners) and gain a huge profit. As of now
bitcoin futures are thinly traded instruments but they are leveraged
instruments. Anytime in future, if the volume of such contracts increases,
it will be a good opportunity.

All of these obviously shows that cryptocurrency doesn't solve nor it
intends to solve such problems and that it should be just seen as a computer
science marvel solving a lot of problems that already existed with our
current set of distributed systems rather than a game-changing future.
