Last year in April, I remembered it has been 9 years since I have switched to Linux full time. Nine years just just passed by so easily. It was almost like yesterday when I was waiting for the release of Ubuntu 11.04 LTS (Natty Narwhal).\nWhy is this anniversary special? Because that’s the first heavy long term bet I took on myself to go venture out into this amazing world of computers and explore how machines works, how software works, how hardware works, how does all the magic happen, and most importantly, how can I be the magician?\nWhy write annual reports in the first place? Because, I want to held accountable for each year I spend on earth. As most things, this would too happen in phases. This is my first year out of college and as an apprentice I want to focus majorly on learning, improving my competitive advantage, and have a baseline capital and network. Readers of these reports would get to observe me through the phases. Here is a nice poem by Shakespeare titled “All the World’s A Stage”, let me know how you think about it.\nThings I learned this year\nTech\nRust, Go and Backend\nI started with Rust in Q2 by helping Amit Upadhyay build FifthTry. Before this, I was sort of in a motion to explore more in the finance/business side and was reading and pulling the trigger on a few ideas. I knew that I had to change this and rust was there to seize the show. My personal preference of programming languages before using rust was C &gt; C++ &gt; Python &gt; Javascript &gt; every thing else. Sure, I had tried out haskell in between but I couldn’t get into a state where I could easily write real world code and support it in production. I was too bored to write APIs in C or C++ and Python &amp; JavaScript without static types seemed too forgiving for my adulthood. I wanted something that gave me the powers and responsibilities of C while having the energetic youthful attitude so that the mundane tasks of checking and error handling are taken cared of. Rust is strongly typed and has “type wrappers” for errors so that it becomes difficult to ignore them. Once the concept of ownership, borrowing and lifetime of data is understood, memory management becomes a breeze thanks to having immutable state by default with the option to make it mutable by adding a special keyword. It’s also one of the few languages which isn’t cursed with OOP. Rust also comes with a special assistant a.k.a the compiler, which is unlike the compilers of other languages because it has some of the most descriptive errors. Amit challenged me that I could just learn rust by reading compiler messages and only the introduction of rust language. He won!\nRust made me fell in love with learning new programming languages once again.\nGo was always on the back of my mind as it managed to make quite some noises. I had earlier tried the syntax by following gobyexamples but hadn’t really worked on a production project in it. Luckily Carousell has a major portion of their services in Go and were slowly deprecating python and moving fully to Go. Carousell had been hosting their support helpdesk on zendesk and wanted to customize more aspects of it while still retaining some aspects. A customized chatbot would help with better customer conversations and more successful closures since the chat journeys could be customized, have a custom recommender system for choosing helpdesk articles, and A/B tested for our particular usecase. Go made me learn all the basics of what was happening underneath while Django and other frameworks choose to hide and it absolutely blew my mind. Using Carousell’s Orion framework, I had gained some proficiency in maintaining the CROP tool with security and stability patches, migrated another service to the very new version of Orion and added better observability, creating a new service and exposing HTTP &amp; GRPC and handling the business logic by querying/persisting data. I had in my mind that I should get some sort of a boilerplate ready and implement the basic things so that I will learn better and it could be useful for me in future to reference from.\nElm, CSS and Frontend\nElm is the reason I started loving frontend. I remember distinctly when starting out I had the task of building a sort of a Pull Request page which has a title input, description input, and submit button. I was so naive that I created something like this:\n\n  \n\n\nI had been using GitHub for quite some while now and this just felt so horrible and it had so few elements to make mistakes. Only when I saw GitHub’s new issue page, I realized why it didn’t look as good as GitHub’s. From going to having very little design sense, I quickly transformed into making usable and not-so-ugly designs which I would consider a very good progress. Elm makes me want to do more and more of frontend programming. It’s a purely functional language with a unique architecture of defining a model to store state, the view function to operate on the state and generate HTML elements, update message passing mechanism to modify the state according to the user’s actions and a subscription function to listen to outside events. Imagining things this way seemed a lot more intuitive to me rather than writing HTML, CSS and JS. Plus, any mistake I made, elm compiler was kind enough to hold my hand through my mistakes and really take the pain out of debugging to make my life a chill breeze.\nProduct Development\nAs a part of Fifthtry, I could give suggestions to Amit who would then polish it and we would implement it together since I had a lot to learn. Once I joined Carousell, all those skills I learned were put to good use as I was given a well-defined success criteria with a lot of leeway on the tech side and how operational things would work. I was responsible for maintaining the customer support chat bot ensuring the reliability and usefulness of it for users. I learned how to prove one’s ability to ask for ownership of the project, manage to slice up work and execute it.\nSupporting Production Code\nThe only people using Fifthtry were the initial people working on it and Amit’s friends. At Carousell, there were a hell lot of users and it was my first time writing software which is going to be used by so many people and has to work 24x7. I think I have come a long way from writing single file programs meant to be run once on desktop vs services which have to work 24x7 on a remote machine.\nDealing with Tech Debt\nI think the trick when dealing with tech debt is patience. As I had started maintaining the CROP tool, I had to introduce several logs and improve the error handling quickly just to figure out what’s exactly happening. Code is often always considered the single source of truth and documentation may exist, may not exist, may be outdated. At times, it is a long way before one could actually see through what was happening and one always feels lost and the only light which needs to be followed is to do the user journeys and attach a debugger to/or check logs for each request being processed and move slowly line by line to keep inspecting the variables. It is crucial to proactively communicate the state of technical debt so that it’s easier for everyone in the team when it comes to task estimation.\nFinance / Business\nBe comfortable reading financial statements\nFinancial Statements can at times look scary and can contain immense amount of information. I did know the basics of reading a balance sheet, income statement, cash-flow statement right after my first year of college and I could be an accountant for a small lemonade shop. But then I got more serious in the business of investing money so I had to dig in deeper. I started out with some of the toughest and most difficult to interpret financial statements i.e. the big banks and financial companies. Of course, I wasn’t of the opinion that I had to purposely choose the hardest ones for myself. I am strongly convinced in the idea that financials do very well and help in the growth of emerging countries like India where capital is scarce. So to invest a heavy amount of my portfolio in financials, I made a rule that the more I learned about accounting, the more I could invest.\nFinancial Institutions\nFinancials’ raw material is money: They borrow money in different forms (using contracts) and pay a different rate. The way they calculate their liabilities and interest expense depends on the approach an accountant takes and different ways of borrowing money give different amounts of flexibility in recording the liabilities and interest expense. For e.g. banks/NBFCs at times borrow using coupon bonds and zero coupon bonds. Now zero coupon bonds give flexibility to the accountant to either charge the interest expense to the I/S statement or they can entirely skip the I/S and directly deduct the amount from equity reserves which of course mis-states the “true income” since it directly updates the B/S instead of updating the B/S through P/L statement . The coupon bonds could have been issued at a discount or a premium and liability calculations have to reflect that appropriately.\nFinancials’ product is credit: The loans which they have given to various people show up in the asset side of B/S. The asset side can disappear without any warning but the liability stays strong which is why banks often get into trouble. A careful reading of their assets tells us what they are doing with the money and whether they are putting it to a good use or not. Lots and lots of magic can happen on the asset side. The promoter can lend to one of his private companies with the intention of not paying it back. The asset under distress can be sold off with kickbacks to promoters when sold below the intrinsic value. The non-performing loans could be hidden by giving the borrower can extra loan to service the previous loan and interest. The loans could be given to riskier borrowers where the interest rate isn’t reflective of the premium to be charged on those loans. The promoter could be obsessed with growth and gives out more loans by reducing the required credit quality and financing it’s lending by raising more debt thus increasing leverage because it needs to show growth to the analyst covering the stock which in turns help to raise money by selling more stock to investors so that the company can lend and borrow even more.\nMost of what happens in asset side is unknown to an investor who is only reliant on public filings. So public investors develop their own sort of “sniffing tests” or “smoke signals”. While this isn’t the right medium to go in full detail about the various sniffing tests, I can say one thing: Each one should have their own sniffing test. Having the privilege to see the financial states at different point in time and the transition from one state to another, tells you a lot about what was going on in the promoter’s mind. Promoters often give information in various forms i.e. coming to TV, giving ppts, writing annual letters like this one, etc. Almost of my sniffing tests are dis-guised forms of checking inconsistency in a story. Mind you, telling stories is a core component of all promoters’ job, but, the more coherent the stories, the better I like it. I believe that every story a promoter tells has a number trail which needs to be checked which a rich dimension of information available for analysis. Buffett has a saying, “If you find one cockroach, there are usually more hidden somewhere”, and I have found this pattern occurring time and again especially in financials.\nManufacturing Business\nI also happen to own a bike manufacturer. These business tend to have long-lived assets in terms of factory, machinery, etc. Learning to read them made me read up on accounting for depreciation and inventory. Their financial statements are much simpler to understand than banks/NBFCs. Their product is easy to understand, they sell bikes. Customer pays them while giving the order for a bike and expects a delivery. They make good margins and have a strong brand re-call. It manages to pass the “litmus test competitive advantage” i.e. whether users would pay first and get the product later which is evident through it’s working capital {{ compute working capital }} requirements.\nFMCG / Cigarettes Business\nWhat I like about large-cap FMCG businesses in India:\n\nDistribution\nBrand recall\nQuality Assurance\nEssential items so very predictable volumes\nLow cash conversion cycle thus less capital required to generate top line\nStrong Return on Equity and Cash flow left to reinvest or return to shareholders\n\nITC as a cash equivalent: Selling cigarettes is a recession free business. Even during Nazi era in Germany cigarettes were a hot commodity. If available at a good yield, it throws off cash to hold an option like position where all the upside of future profits is captured while having debt like returns.\nSo as you see, I like to own businesses and accounting helps me to understand what’s going on inside a business so I read more of accounting when I am required to understand the financial statements. I haven’t studied accounting for pension liabilities yet (a small portion of a few of my portfolio companies) but have scheduled it for a later date.\nGoals for next year\nTech\nGo deep into the Golang and try to soak up as much knowledge as possible given that I have to write it at my full time job and try to do some side-projects based on golang to improve skills and create something useful for myself. Also, keep reading blogs/articles/documentation to keep up.\nFinance / Business\nMaintenance Research\nI have lots of stock ideas now which can yield me 20-25% for the next 5 years. What I have to do now is to bet heavily on them and that’s only possible when I get more information about them. This year’s progress should be that I should start reading the financial documents much faster.\nPortfolio Management\nThanks to my salary, I have constant cash-flow coming in which begs to be invested. I have set some investment policies which I have to adhere to and I would have to buy/sell different sort of assets to manage my portfolio.\nGoals for the next decade\nAbility to fend for yourself\nI am glad to have realized the importance of this through many lucky events of my life. I had plenty of moments which led me to believe that, “Geez, one really has to rely only on himself” and thus I started working on it.\nThese are some of the things I have learned to do, and I have to keep getting better at it:\n\nKnowing how to ask for help\nKnowing how to find your way around the internet and look for things you need\nHaving a decent education to be employable\nKnowing your way around your computer (terminal) inside out by exploring the secret dungeons ;)\nLearning to experiment, breaking and fixing things yourself\nKnowing which information to trust by diving deep beyond surface levels to get crux of the matter by identifying credible sources and learning about the assumptions and validating them with your own world view\nKnowing how to trade time, money and energy efficiently\nKnowing how to make friends\nBuilding credible sources of information for an edge\nFocusing on building a strong fundamental base of knowledge for sustained long term competitive advantage\nAbility to identify opportunities and market dislocation to put the skills and capital to use\n\nAbility to read and interpret technical &amp; trade documents\nDeciphering what’s written and understanding how to carefully develop plans/strategies and executing it. Whether it’s technical documentation, specifications, annual reports, financial statements, legal contracts, the ability to read and understand what’s happening around you is critical for continued success. The best part about this skill is that compounding works in it’s true sense over here. These documents often have very significant information hidden in it and gives an edge which other people will often find difficult to compete against.\nAbility to do a start a company and run it\nI believe these are the key things to start a company:\n\nIdentifying market need\nSkills\nCapital\nCourage\nNetwork\n\n",id:"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/annual-report-fy20-21/",title:"Annual Report FY20-21: A decade of using Linux"},"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/annual-report-fy21-22/":{body:"Product &amp; Engineering\nCarousell: Chatbot\nCarousell uses Zendesk to power their support help desk which contained\nwritten articles and a chatbot. Their chatbot didn't allow us to configure\nthe chat journeys and their recommendations systems wasn't tuned for\nus, and it was costing Carousell around Rs. 7-8L/month. A senior\nengineer had done some initial exploration and written a few RFCs on\nhow to architect the system. The work was split in backend and frontend\nand I was responsible to take the RFC and implement it for the backend.\nWe had a separate engineer to setup parts of frontend since I wasn't\nwell versed with frontend. Carousell has open-sourced Orion framework\nwhich it uses internally to power all the microservices and I was\nresponsible for creating, owning and maintaining a new microservice.\nI had been given very well defined work with objective metrics for\nwork well done and I got all the help I needed. This seemed\na perfect way to get started as someone fresh out of college.\nMy manager and a senior understood the importance of learning how\nto slice up the work and after I did some explorations, we all sat\ntogether to slice up the tasks, create JIRA tickets, and schedule\nthem. They believed in giving me as much freedom as required but\nintervening when something was taking more time than expected and\nthat's how I learned to time-box issues so that they don't end up\ndragging me. Since our team didn't have a frontend engineer, we\nhad asked for help from another team, and he managed to setup\nthe barebones and did a handover before the backend was ready.\nThis had a lucky coincidence since I was looking to get my hands\ndirty with frontend.\nWe had planned for two phases, where in the first phase, we would\nrelease it only in one language (English) and see how it's working\nout before choosing to release for multiple languages. After the\nbackend was done, I integrated it with the frontend, did testing,\nput it behind feature flags for a controlled roll out and finally\nreleased it. I was so overjoyed once we started small roll outs\nand saw it working properly. We then did a full roll out that\nsame work and it was getting some serious amount of users. This\nwas the first piece of software that I had put in production which\nwas accessed by so many users.\nThen came time for Phase II, the DB was designed in a way to\naccommodate for multiple languages because this requirement\nwas known at the time of designing, so we just had to wait\nfor the translations to arrive so that we could get started.\nAfter the translations came, only a month of work was required\nin backend and frontend to release it in production. Again, we\ndid a controlled roll out and after a month of a full roll out,\nit had around 50k users a day. My software had never reached\nthis wide an audience earlier, and I was overjoyed that it\nworked properly. In the full year after release, we had only\none downtime, and it worked correctly without any maintenance\nlong after I was gone.\n\n  \n\nCarousell's tech team is quite mature and a lot of things like\nCI/CD, logging, infra, etc were already setup with very\nRelease for multiple languages\ngood practices which helped me in learning the ropes.\nFinance/Business\nI have often been asked this question as to why I invest time in\nmanaging my equity portfolio myself considering that my capital base\nisn't enough to justify the time spent on this to which I have always\nreplied, \"It's the irrational bet I want to take on myself\", but here\nis what I never told any of them, \"If you don't take that irrational\nbet on yourself which can change your personal growth trajectory forever,\nthen no one else is going to bet on you.\"\nHere's the thing about irrational bets on yourself:\n\nYou look like a fool doing it, and you learn to not be bothered by it\nIt's almost always mispriced and the upside is huge and if planned\nwell the downside is limited\nIt's best to align the bet in a direction where one is effortlessly\ngood at\nIt takes a very long time to materialise which is why patience, innate\ncuriosity, and love for the craft are crucial to survive, otherwise,\nit becomes too easy to give up or be burned out\n\n12 years ago, I took an irrational bet to install linux, and it took a\ndecade for the bet to materialise. Managing my own equity portfolio is\nanother irrational bet I want to take on myself and think I am well\nprepared to 'pay the toll'.\nIn 2018, I started keeping good track of my finances (initially using\nledger and hledger, now I just use Sheets/Excel with Dropbox paper).\nI like to keep a track of Balance Sheet so that I can understand my\nportfolio and make bets appropriately. I often take leverage (capped)\nto hold positions and pay interest on it. I made a\n5 year plan of saving a minimum of let's say x amount and maximum of\n2x amount. The minimum amount was the threshold I kept to qualify\nmyself to start a startup and get married. I had budgeted out\nemergency fund, marriage fund, and startup fund so that I can be my\nown investor. These savings are supposed to be the cushion which let\nme enjoy life as well as pay for my irrational bets.

Luckily Naresh Ramesh\nworked there and I spoke to him about what Setu\nis doing/planning to do and I was pretty excited about the prospects\nof Account Aggregator. I joined the Data Gateway and Account Aggregator\nteam and I was amazed with the culture of experimentation. Setu was\nplanning to launch a chatbot for BBPS payments on WhatsApp and some\nsetup had been done, but I was tasked with taking it to production and\nfixing it up for marketing. I made it ready and I started talking\nwith my friends about how they make electricity/gas/fastag payments\nand quickly found that the existing UPI apps provide a much\nmore seamless experience. Not only did others provide a seamless experience,\ngetting this into the hands of user i.e. distribution required expensive\nmarketing and Setu had the DNA of B2B sales. I communicated about this to\nthe CTO &amp; CEO and we quickly shutdown the efforts on this so as to focus\nmore on other aspects where we can build a long lasting competitive\nadvantage.\nI then started building Reverse Penny Drop (RPD). The premise of this product\nis that many regulated entities like banks/NBFCs, brokers, insurers\nneed to verify bank account details like account number, IFSC and\nname before proceeding forward. Before this product there were\nonly two ways to verify bank accounts:\n\nAsk user to input account number and IFSC, transfer Rs. 1 to the account,\nand fetch the confirmation details from bank\nAsk the user to upload a cancelled cheque and involve Operations/Support\nteam to verify the details\n\nBoth the approaches are tedious especially if the passbook or cheque book aren't\nhandy and eventually lead to user drop-offs during the onboarding journey.\nWith RPD, the end-user clicks on a generated link and if the user is on\nmobile, it shows a choice of opening their favourite UPI app and if on web,\nit shows a QR code. Once the user pays Rs. 1 using this link with UPI, we\nobtain all the required details, forward it so that the onboarding journey\ncan proceed and then refund the Rs. 1 back to the end-user.\nWe found our first pilot customer (Kissht) and I was thrilled. It took some\npainful iterations to connect our systems with our banking partner and it felt\ntotally worth it when it worked for the first time. To test our competitive\nedge, we asked our next customers to pay before use and it was well adopted.\nThis instilled a lot of confidence in me and Setu also wanted to focus more\non this product after our initial success which paid off immensely.\nRPD is an industry-first product, and just when we launched it, we wanted\nto make sure we are doing right by the customers and verifying information\nthat this new product provided. The simplest way to do that would be to do\na penny drop (deposit Rs. 1 to end-user) to all accounts, but it would also\nbe costly and would end up eating into our margins.\nI did some exploration and figured out a lot of bank accounts have a pattern,\nand if we verified a few of them belonging to one pattern, we can skip\npenny drop to that entire pattern. Due to the skewed distribution of bank\naccounts (top 10 banks have 90% of customers), we were quite lucky and\nhad to do a penny drop on a much smaller set because of this.\nThe above exercise helped us in figuring out that some of the end-users\nwere using Prepaid Instructions like FamPay UPI which don't have the\nKYC of a bank account but our product was treating them as a valid\nbank account. We took up the task to informing our customers about\nthis through the webhook which forwarded them account details and\nspecifically asked the brokers, lenders and insurers to treat this\nas invalid accounts because of KYC since we didn't want our customers\non the wrong side of compliance. Our customers relied on us, and we\nconsidered it our responsibility to build this trust. We also identified\nvarious corner cases like Canara bank accounts and wrote\nabout all of our findings publicly on the documentation.\nThe trick to a successful product with happy customers is always customer\nsupport. On running the pilot with our first customer, I had extensive\nconversations with customers about their flows and the most optimum way\nof designing them. We got to know what they did in preparation before\ncalling our APIs and what they did after which was crucial in understanding\nhow to expand our product so as to capture more value and thus make\nintegrations more friendlier.\nFor the Data Gateway team, conducting such research was crucial\nconsidering that we have product offerings for various aspects of KYC\nand we managed to successfully cross-sell other service once we provided\nthem an excellent onboarding/customer support experience with one product.\nInternally everyone recognized RPD as the \"Hero product\" which become\na gateway for future cross-sell relationships. It's better to start a new\nrelationship with a customer with something you know for sure will make\nan amazing first impression, especially if it is also the highest margin\nproduct.\nScaling systems and humans\nAfter a few months of launching this, a significant portion of my time\nwas being consumed by going to integrations call with our customers\nand manually onboarding them. Integrations call comes after we have\ngiven them a sales demo, they showcase it internally, and their\nengineers have some questions which they feel aren't answered in docs.\nThese calls were important since this is Setu's most important chance\nto close a sale if we have provided a sufficient\nconvincing evidence of how the product can help them and our quality\nof customer support. I am proud of the fact that once a customer had\nan integration call with me, there was no way I was going to let Setu\nlose that customer. Yes, 100% conversions, you read that right. I\nwrote internal docs extensively so that everyone in the company was\non the same page and more importantly people didn't need to keep\npinging me for trivial issues which could easily be solved by reading\nthe docs and following the steps. This also meant I had to make\nsure integrations engineers and customer success was well aware\nabout the nuances of the product, even though I made sure I attended\nall integrations call, I still wanted other things to be taken\ncared of without involving me. I made some integration engineers\npitch RPD to me and I kept asking them questions so that I could\nprepare them to take the demo calls so that I could exclusively\nfocus more on closing customers in integrations call.\nOnce we reached product-market fit and figured out how to sell this,\nI was then fully involved in making sure our systems can scale and\nhandle all the new traffic. While understanding the request flow\nand the paths involved, I had some suspicions about load balancing\nnot being done properly at nginx level, so I SSH'ed into the containers\nand ran a load test. My suspicions were right and load balancing\nwas incorrectly setup up. I drew up an RFC (Review For Comments) with\nsome of the proposed solution including some short-term fixes\nand some long-term ones and after a healthy debate we were able to\nmake progress on this. Now all we needed was to click a few buttons\non AWS and viola, the machines could keep up with all the new traffic\nwhenever required. We successfully engineered a money-printing\nmachine ;-)\nI made RPD the highest-margin product of Setu with a monthly recurring\nrevenue of Rs. 30L within 9 months. It faced downtime once with\nour pilot customer, after which it had zero-downtime till I left. RPD\nwas the thing for me which made all the work that I have done till\nnow look like a foot note. \nRedevelopment: Taking a stand\nMiddle class dream\nMost of the societies in Mumbai were constructed in 60s-80s when the\ncooperative housing societies laws had just come to force. This enabled\nmiddle-class people to pool capital together to buy land, construct\nbuilding and allocate flats among themselves. Most of the buildings\nhad a low number of floors. By 2010s, a lot of those buildings had\nstarted to get old and needed more repair. Luckily the airspace on\ntop of the land wasn't as utilized which is why real estate developers/\nbuilders could approach society to demolish the building in order to\ncreate much bigger buildings and in return get some portion of flats\nto sell. This resulted in a win-win situation as the original owners\ncould get 20-80% extra area in flat, along with rents during construction\nand some corpus amount. I remember, some of my friends in school would\ntell me that after redevelopment, there will be swimming pool, bigger\nhouses and all of this for free. There's just something about this\n\"free stuff\" which triggers a lot of middle-class people's dreams.\nNeedless to say, my parents too were affected by this.\nRisks\nVery few people truly understand the risks associated and have the\noperational know-how to mitigate those risks. It's also in no one's\ninterest to explain the risks associated which is why they often\nget ignored. The redevelopment deal is essentially that house owners\nwould willingly get their house demolished and in return get\nsomething extra in the form of area in new construction, corpus, rent,\netc. Some questions to ponder on:\n\nWhat happens when building is demolished but builder doesn't have\nthe required funds to complete the project?\nWhat if the building constructed doesn't meet local government's\nrules and doesn't get permissions for habitation?\nWhat happens if the builder extends his deliverables timeline\nso as to fetch better prices for his allocation of flats?\nWhat happens if the builder sells his allocation of flats but\ncannot complete the project?\nWhat happens if the builder refuses to pay the rents?\n\nA significant portion of these risks can be mitigated by careful due\ndiligence of the builder/developer taking on the project, carefully\ndrafting the contracts, holding them accountable to RERA laws, and\nhaving adequate safety and security clauses to mitigate against\nthe risks.\nThe situation\nThe governance of cooperative housing societies is in the hands\nof elected representatives called The Managing Committee. Usually,\nhow the redevelopment proceeds is that the society gets conveyance\ndeed on the land so as to establish the society as the owner of the\nland in order to allow society to formally enter into contracts for\nredevelopment. Once the society passes the resolution to go ahead\nwith redevelopment, they typically appoint a Project Management\nConsultant (PMC) who oversees tender process, does due diligence before\naccepting bids, drafts Developer Agreement and other legal\ndocuments, and keeps a check on the construction progress as well\nas the quality. The Managing Committee had a person henceforth\nreferenced as Mr. UM who is himself\na partner at a construction company and he brewed an innovative plan.\nSelf-redevelopment is also an option in case the society chooses\nto not involve builder. Mr. UM understood the middle class dream\nextremely well and started selling it aggressively for self-\nredevelopment. The society would need funds to execute a plan like\nthis so it became essential to raise funds and thus they allowed\nexisting members to buy area in the non-existent future area for\na steep discount and many committee members pooled capital. With\nthis, the society put up their construction plans, paid fees\nto government for partial Intimation of Disapproval (IOD). The Managing\nCommittee made a conscious decision to not appoint PMC because\nit will start interfering with Mr. UM's plans. After half-work\nwas done, the society found itself in a position where it was\nunable to raise further capital. Mr. UM then convinced members\nthat it was in their best interest to appoint a builder/developer\nnow. Not so surprisingly after a rigged tender process, Mr. UM's\nconstruction company came out as the top bidder and the Managing\nCommittee started pushing this decision on members.\nWe understood what was happening and we brewed our own plan to\ngo against the establishment. This started with an innocent looking\none page letter.\n\n  \n\nThe Managing Committee tried very hard to not answer the question\nby giving an illusion of answering the questions.\nNevertheless, we persisted and openly called out their ill-intentions\nso as to corner them into giving us the information which they were\nlegally obligated to give. After the Development Agreement was made\nand given to us, we found it crazy that such an agreement which was\nagainst the interest of members and fully in favour of the builder\nwas being pushed. Worst part was that the committee members themselves\nhad flats in society and were putting themselves and society in\nimmense risk for their personal benefit. It's not that they made\na boatload of money doing this, sure they made a little, but taking\nthe risk of their primary home which made up a significant portion\nof their net worth for making extra pennies in their retirement\nwas a dumb decision they were taking which didn't even safeguard\nthe interest of their own families.\nThe below letter summarises the deal offered to the society:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nCourage to go against the establishment\nThe same committee members have been \"ruling\" over the society\nsince many decades and were unchallenged until they met me and my\nbrother Krushan Bauva. They\nhad done good work in the past which is why they had won the trust\nof the members and every member just agreed with the committee's\ndecision. Me and my brother were the necessary Agents of Chaos\nrequired to steer the society away from hitting the iceberg.\nThis involved standing up for oneself and refusing to allow others\nto control our destiny. We openly talked about what was really\nhappening in the name of the redevelopment and we did receive\na lot of hate in return. But we persisted because we knew we\nwere right. The Managing Committee had in between managed to\nconvince members to accept the shitty deal and created a\nperception that we were nuisance who were blocking redevelopment,\nwhich was far from truth. We faced resistance from members who\nsupported The Managing Committee and used all the tricks in their\nbook to pull us down and ruin our reputation. None of this could\ndeter us, we knew what we had to do and we executed it.\nAbility to read and interpret trade documents\nCourage without knowledge and intellect is foolishness. I did some\nreading of what are the steps in redevelopment, RERA Act,\nMaharashtra Cooperative Societies Act and a few more pdfs which\nhelped me explain how the law works. Youtube videos of CA Ramesh\nPrabhu were quite helpful too. I am pleased that the goal I had\nset for myself earlier regarding that I should be able to read,\nunderstand and interpret any kind of trade documents is paying off\nbig time. This was also an interesting exercise as I found out more\nabout what kind of due diligence can be done on real estate\ndevelopers with the help of publicly available information.\nCorner by opening up your options and restricting others options\n\nA pen is mightier than the sword.\n\nI could only grasp the full extent of this sentence only after I\nhad involved myself in redevelopment. Our strategy was simple, we\nasked questions by writing letters which exposed the blunders and\nillegality of the decisions of the committee. Till our involvement,\nall communication was oral and committee members frequently broke\ntheir word, and their reputation meant nothing for them. Our first\nmove was to bring this on paper. This move allowed us to always\nbe on the offense while forced the committee members to play defense.\nWe then controlled the direction while the committee members tried\nhard to play catch up and were often behind us by a margin. Slowly,\nwe accumulated a lot of proofs with which we could prove the\nillegality of the committee and the redevelopment. But this wasn't\nenough as cooperative housing societies follow the majority's\ndecisions and the committee still had a strong hold of the majority.\nWhile we could always approach the courts of law, a much more\nsurer option was to target the majority. Every elected body draws\nit's power from majority vote. As one starts to build a minority\nof dissatisfied people, one slowly chips away some power one by one,\nuntil very little is left, for it to finally collapse.\nExposing the cracks in a majority in order to break it\nMy brother's friend is the son of CA Ramesh Prabhu who is an eminent\nfigure in Mumbai's redevelopment and also runs his own PMC. On\nmeeting him, he made us understand the importance of executing our\nplan not by pointing out the illegalities but by winning over\nthe majority. He also suggested various things we can do to start\nattacking their majority in order to break it. Turns out, nothing\nis more important than building the confidence of other members\nsince the committee drew their strength from these members. This\nhad a direct effect on decreasing their strength and increasing\nours which finally handicapped them and we were successful in\nkicking out Mr. UM's construction company.\nThe redevelopment story hasn't still concluded. I am sure, this\nwill continue to drag me. I am tired of this but will still have\nto be involved since my dad's flat is at risk.\nFinance/Business\nThis was a busy year, and I was mostly focused on adding to my\nwinning positions (bought more of IDFC First Bank). I also opened\na US brokerage account and bought some Apple and Google shares.\nI think they are terrific businesses and the recent tech downturn\ngave me a nice entry point with some margin of safety.\nDoing a Startup\nI left my job to do a startup for the simple reason that I want to make\nyear 2023 count for myself. I have been lucky enough to have gotten\nthe opportunities as well as skilled enough to make the most out of each\nopportunity thus made each year count till now, and I have to keep doing\nthat in future. I started searching for good startup ideas aggressively\nsince start of H2 FY 22-23 knowing that my competitive advantage was\nin writing software for servers and my preferred business model would\nbe Software as a Service. Luckily I found an interesting problem to\nbe solved where software companies are spending lots of time and money\nto build it themselves. Processing of incoming webhooks and their timely\ndelivery is crucial in this age of event driven architectures. Typical\nexamples would be that Stripe/Razorpay would send e-commerce companies\na webhook to notify when someone has made a payment so that \norder can be processed, Github sends a webhook to CI/CD whenever a commit\nis pushed/pull request is opened, etc to trigger workflows. The alternative\nto webhooks\nwould involve continuously asking the other server about the status\nof information and this can be very inefficient and error-prone.\nThis is a problem I faced when at Setu working on Reverse Penny Drop\nwherein we were responsible for sending payment information to our\ncustomers as soon as we received a payment confirmation from our\nbanking partner. I was personally responsible to make sure our\ncustomers don't keep pooling our servers buy going in calls and strongly\ndissuading them and instead helping build the trust in webhooks.\n",id:"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/annual-report-fy22-23/",title:"Annual Report FY22-23: Reverse Penny Drop & Redevelopment"},"https://bauva.com/blog/":{body:"",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/",title:"Blog Posts"},"https://bauva.com/blog/cryptocurrencies-arent-a-solution/":{body:"Cryptocurrencies were alleged started because public lost trusts in banks\nand other financial institutions as a result of the subprime mortgage\ncrisis in 2007-08.\nIn the height of a lot of people trying to claim that cryptocurrencies\nwould change how we do banking and financial transactions, I wish to\nexpress my personal thoughts about its limitations (as of now). Of course,\ntechnology changes and in future, the limitations can be addressed easily.\nThis article addresses why banks aren't afraid of cryptocurrencies\n(otherwise, they would have made a cryptocurrency of their own before most\nof the people even came to know about it).\nBitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency's\npaper\ndescribes bitcoin as:\n\nA purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going\nthrough a financial institution.\n\nAs described in the paper, bitcoin does exactly the same thing and nothing\nelse.\nDefinition of a bank as provided by\nwikipedia:\n\nA bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public\nand creates credit. Lending activities can be performed either directly\nor indirectly through capital markets.\n\nDid you notice the remarkable difference in both the definitions?\nWikipedia and research papers can often be obscure and a definition doesn't\nreally help a lot. So let me explain.\nBanks provide liquidity in capital markets\nWhat \"providing liquidity\" means is that can either take money or provide\nmoney whenever needed.\nThe main purpose of banks is to take public money and lend to\nthe needy. In return, they give the public an interest on the money\ndeposited as an opportunity cost and against inflation. If you have money\ntied up under carpets like a Gujju or Pablo chachu, the inflation rate is\ngoing to eat up the value of the money (but won't be your major issue if\nyou are Gujarati or Pablo).\nCommercial banks\nCommercial banks\nmainly offer savings account and fixed deposit for earning\ninterest and current account for businesses to operate where they don't\ncharge any interest and neither do they charge any fees for that. With the\ndeposits they take, they invest it in debt which people want in the form\nof mortgage, vehicle loan, and up to some extent to companies.\nSuper interesting fact:\nHave you seen the TV show Medici Masters of Florence?\nIt describes the rise of The Medici family in late 1300s starting with\nGiovanni di Medici at inception and Cosimo de Medici in its prime stage.\nThe Medici family controlled The Medici Bank which was the first formal\nbank the world has ever seen and which has said to introduce the concept of\ncredit in this world. They were the ones who fueled renaissance through\ntheir ingenious financial innovation to support entrepreneurs to take risk\nto earn return and be supported by the other citizens who's deposits will\nbe kept at the bank and earn the dividends/interests. They invented the\nconcept of limited liability in setting up bank brances as independent from\ntheir parent entity so as to mitigate risk and having local stakeholders\nwho run the operations overseas hold substancial stakes for skin in the\ngame. They proved that they could scale the banking business as much\nas to capture and create new trade and convince The Pope to be his personal\nbanker in the age where Church was the highest corrupt authority (Middle\nAges is 1300s).\nInvestment banks\nInvestment banks\nhelp companies raise money through IPO or bond issues.\nThey also have a network of HNIs (High Net worth individuals) and\ninstitutions who want to park money in order to generate returns. They also\nact as market makers in exchanges and buy/sell assets when no one is\nwilling to. They help to provide a route for retail investors to invest\nin public companies and charge brokerage for that.\nWell, you would be now thinking that all of this can be done through\nblockchain technology (not essentially cryptocurrency), right?\nIf yes, then you might be a blockchain developer. Kudos, but do read the\nentire thing. I promise you would learn something from it and it would be\nfun.\nLet's talk about the origin of money, banking system and others. To read\nin more detail about origins of money, read the book\n\"The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World\"\nby Niall Ferguson.\nElizabethan Era\nThis period\nis regarded as the \"golden period\" in the English history. If\nyou are good at history, you would remember that Shakespeare lived in this\nera and if you are one of his fans, you might have read the book\n\"The Merchant in Venice\".\nLending in this era was mostly peer to peer like\nShylock gave money to Bassanio while Antonio (his friend and a wealthy\nperson who currently had his money parked in outside waters) would cover\nit in case of default.\nSo to be historically precise, banking and lending were always done\npeer-to-peer. But something happened where people realized the need for a\nbank.\nAs the story of \"A Merchant of Venice\" unfolds, a rumour spreads out that\nAntonio's ships have wrecked and thus he has lost most of his investment.\nThis triggers a default of the debt. I hope you see an issue over here.\nAntonio was a person with an extremely good credit history but he still\ndefaulted because of something beyond his control. Peer-to-Peer lending\nhad failed because it had failed to diversify. What are the chances that\nshipwrecks? Had Shylock given his money to a million people, the losses\nwould be minuscule and could be easily covered up with risk premiums in\nthe interest rate.\nFederal Reserve of United States\nThe concept of\nFederal Reverse Bank\nin the United States was borrowed from European countries in the 1910s.\nWhat was happening is that some people with\nmalicious intent would declare that a bank is going to go bankrupt even\nthough it was actually quite healthy. No bank keeps deposited money in\nlockers and pays interest on them. Instead, a major portion of the money is\ninvested. When all the people rushed to take their money out, the bank\nwould be unable to clear it's current liabilities and would go bankrupt.\nThe Federal bank became the liquidity provider since it could inject money\nwhenever it wished and give it to the bank to cover up for their short-term\nliabilities. This is the current solution to the age-old banking problem.\nI have presented an extremely simple model and of course this isn't quite\ntrue. If you are interested in reading more about this please read\nthis paper\npublished by Bank of England pointed out in the comments below by Rohan.\nSubprime Mortgage Crisis\nThis is said to be fueled because of the extremely low interest rates\nduring the tenure of\nAlan GreenSpan since he\nstrongly believed in deregulation and that market is the best decider\nof the price. To the blockchain folks, what this means is that a common\nconsensus can't always work better for themselves. When dealing with humans,\nwe always have to take into account the human emotions like fear and greed\notherwise, we would end up like\nLong Term Capital Management\nand as much as smart as they were, they ended up losing money for their\ninvestors.\nThere are many more such stories to include to prove why a central\nregulation system is required but then this already long article would\nbecome even longer. The book \"The Ascent of Money\" already describes\nwhy\nFree Markets\nfailed to solve this issue.\nAs for the current state, the blockchain industry has no solution in the\nnear term and in fact is already showing problems.\nDominance in Cryptocurrency market\nAn article in medium with the title\n\"Stop. Calling. Bitcoin. Decentralized\"\nexplains the concentration of\nbitcoin miners. Heck, even democracy\nis supposed to be decentralized where \"every citizen gets an equal vote\",\nbut we all know how rigged our system is. It's time we start accepting this fact\nfor cryptocurrencies as well.\nCartels in Cryptocurrency markets\nThere are already many cartels in the futures market of Bitcoin operating\nvia CME which because of their\nleveraged position\nare manipulating\ncryptocurrency prices. Here\nis a medium post explaining this.\nYour broker/exchange isn't decentralized\nMany people who buy cryptocurrency from an exchange or broker don't\nrealize that the transaction they just did while purchasing the\nasset is in fact the same old transaction. One first deposits money in\nthe broker/exchange's bank account. The broker then arranges for the asset\nat market price and takes a commission. After the asset is bought, it can\nbe transferred to anyone which is decentralized. Of course, if\nyou have mined the cryptocurrency, then you shouldn't be worried about\nthis except when to try to sell it in open market.\nThe brokers/exchanges are unregulated private companies. Their\nbalance sheets are not publicly available. You might never know when\nthe broker/exchange might go bankrupt. They don't have to follow rules\nlike other national exchanges do. They don't invest enough in security\nof their platform. They might be using the idle cash in your account to\nbuy cryptocurrency for their account, and guess what, you would never\nknow. How is that bad? Well, if the asset prices go down, the broker/\nexchange made a loss on a trade where they didn't even have to put a\ncollateral, which could be a serious issue if the broker has a high\nleverage. White collar crimes like\nspoofing\nin cryptocurrency exchanges are extremely common. And did I mention\nabout the huge bid ask spread\nthey charge? Ouch, 3-5% of the trade amount\nwould definitely hurt your pockets.\nHigh Volatility\nThe cryptocurrency markets at this point in time are extremely volatile.\nLet's say a merchant sold some goods worth $8000 and\naccording to the current BTC price, the buyer paid 1 BTC. Now, the\nmerchant has an open position in BTC. He can either go in the market and\nquickly sell it and pay the broker/exchange fees of around 3-5% or it\ncan carry forward the open position where he runs the risk of the currency\nbeing devalued. If the next day, BTC prices drop to $7000, then the\nmerchant took a loss of $1000. Of course, if you are a derivatives trader,\nyou could argue that you can hedge the open position using futures and\noptions (one of the strategy being gamma scalping), but then think about\nit again, should a simple merchant be involved in complex derivatives\ntransactions (and pay a hefty fee for that too)? Probably no, right?\nEconomic Benefit\nRemember, the 51% attack wouldn't be fruitful because the computing power\nwould just be wasted and bitcoin's worth will drop? Well, things just\nchanged thanks to the introduction of Bitcoin futures in CME. Now you\ncan have a short position in bitcoin, perform a 51% attack (even easier\nnow because of consolidation of miners) and gain a huge profit. As of now\nbitcoin futures are thinly traded instruments but they are leveraged\ninstruments. Anytime in future, if the volume of such contracts increases,\nit will be a good opportunity.\nAll of these obviously shows that cryptocurrency doesn't solve nor it\nintends to solve such problems and that it should be just seen as a computer\nscience marvel solving a lot of problems that already existed with our\ncurrent set of distributed systems rather than a game-changing future.\n",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/cryptocurrencies-arent-a-solution/",title:"Cryptocurrencies aren't really a solution to our problems"},"https://bauva.com/blog/deploying-with-heroku/":{body:"As their About page reads:\n\nHeroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor\nand scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing\nall those infrastructure headaches.\n\nHeroku is the fastest deployment service that is available right now.\nOne can directly use git to deploy heroku apps with simplicity and ease.\nThe only downside of Heroku is that it can get costly. They only give a\nfew hours of server use per month free, after that it is chargeable.\nNevertheless, for small-scale apps it heroku fits perfectly without having\nthe deployment headache. Heroku also integrates with GitHub so you can\ndirectly deploy from there.\nYou may find a detailed information about heroku from\nhere and you can know more about how it\nworks from here.\nTo learn about deployment process of Heroku I found an online udacity\ncourse named\nDeploying Web Applications with Heroku.\nNote: What follows below are notes of that course which I choose to\npublish online.\nDeployment in a Flash\nWhat is Deployment?\nWhen you are working on code, you mostly work on your own PC and test it\nthere itself. That machine is called as Local Development Environment or\nlocalhost when it can be accessed only by you. When you want other people\nto use your application, you need to put all of the code on some\nserver and execute it there so that your users can use it. Moving the code\nfrom the local development environment to the server is called as\ndeployment.\nWhat is Heroku?\nHeroku will take you application code and make it accessible on the\ninternet with a new simple commands. Heroku is a Platform Service for\nthe developer to upload your code and make it accessible it to everyone.\nThis is called as Platform as a service and is one kind of internet\nproduct available today along with Infrastructure as a service and\nSoftware as a service. PaaS makes it really simple to host the applications\nonline.\nBefore services like Heroku, many developers had to maintain servers where\nthey had to think about the server hardware, software, physical location,\nuptime, security and many more just so that the application runs smoothly.\nWith heroku you can deploy the code with a few commands. Thus the\ndeveloper can focus more on the application and not on deployment.\nHow to Install Heroku\nBasics\nHeroku Account:\nThe first thing we need to do is make sure you have a Heroku account\ncreated. This will give you access to Heroku’s deployment services and\nwill allow you to manage your deployed applications on their web app.\nIt is free to sign up so visit the\nHeroku homepage and sign up for an account.\nHeroku Toolbelt:\nThe next thing you should do is install the Heroku Toolbelt. The toolbelt\nis a command line tool that will expand the functionality of your command\nline to include heroku commands. For example, once installed you will be\nable to use the heroku login command to log into your account from your\ncommand shell. To install the\nHeroku Toolbelt navigate to\ntoolbelt.heroku.com and follow the installation instructions for your\noperating system.\nHeroku Login:\nOnce you have your Heroku account and the toolbelt installed you will\nwant to log in to your Heroku account from the command line. To do this,\nopen up your command line shell and type heroku login. This will prompt\nyou for your Heroku email and password. If you entered your information\ncorrectly, your command line output should look something like the image\nbelow. You won’t have to log in every time you want to deploy, your\ncredentials will be saved for some time, so this is a good command to\nkeep in mind if you get logged out at some point.\nGit Installed:\nHeroku deploys the most recent version of your app by keeping track of\nchanges via Git. Make sure that you have Git installed on your command\nshell. If you do not have Git installed you can visit\nthis link\nto get yourself set up. Most recent MacOS machines come with Git already\ninstalled, and if you have been building applications on your development\nenvironment already, it is likely you have already been using Git.\nClone Repository Now that you have everything you need to get started,\nyou will need to clone the gallery application you are going to deploy.\nOpen up your command line and navigate to the location where you want\nthe repository to live, this is often a projects directory but it can\nbe anywhere you like on your machine as long as it is not within another\nGit repository. If you are not sure if there is a git repository on your\nworking directory you can check using git status. If you get a message\nsaying\nfatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git.\nThis means you are not in a Git repo and you can clone in this location.\nGo to the\nUdacity repository and copy the\nclone URL.\nReturn to your command line and type git clone followed by the git\nclone URL you just copied. This will clone the code on GitHub to your\ncomputer.\nOnce you have installed all the tools and cloned the repository, you\nare ready to go live. It is generally a good idea to check your git status to make sure you are about to deploy the most updated stable\nversion. Let’s deploy!\nHeroku Create:\nTo get yourself deployed on Heroku, you must first create a remote on\nGit. To do this you have to run the heroku create command. This will\nmake a new remote repo named heroku where the code will be pushed to.\nTo ensure you have properly created this remote, run the git remote -v\ncommand, you should see something output that reveals the two remotes\nlisted, origin and heroku.\nGit Push Heroku Master\nNow the last step, the ribbon cutting is the command\ngit push heroku master. This command is very similar to the git push\nthat you may be familiar with when pushing your code to GitHub. Instead\nof pushing it to github via the origin remote, you are pushing it to\nthe heroku remote.\nFrom this point you will see a large output from Heroku that is listing\nall of the libraries and tools that are being installed on the Heroku\nmachine before your code is finally decompressed and launched onto the\nonline server.\nHeroku Open\nOnce you have your application deployed, Heroku will provide you with a\nURL you can visit to see your site. After this you can run heroku open.\nThis will open up a browser window and navigate to the deployed\napplication URL.\nNow your gallery is live! Click on the “New Art Piece” button to see a\nnew image appear!\nTypes of Deployment\nThe different places where your application can live is called as\nenvironments.\nDevelopment environment: When you are developing the application on your\nmachine. This is the local host. You are coding as well as testing the\napplication and building features. This is not deployed.\nProduction environment: Making you application available for users. The\ncode needs to be hosted on some server.\nStaging environment: This is kind of a \"live rehearsal\" for the production\nenvironment. The code is deployed on servers. This includes additional\ntests and sample data.\nDevelopment pipeline is the process of developing the application, testing\nthe application on staging area servers and then actually deploying it\nfor the real world users.\nCommon Functionality\nHeroku and Amazon\nHeroku internally uses Amazon AWS services for their servers. Heroku\ntakes a fully fledged Amazon AWS server and makes small tiny servers out\nof it and then rents it individually.\nLinux Containers\nVirtualized servers that are provided are called as Linux containers.\nLinux containers on same server don't share files though they share\nmemory and storage resources. Heroku calls their special single command\ncontainers as dynos.\nProcfile\nHeroku will allow you one “dyno” or single command container for free.\nThis means that on a free tier Heroku account, you can run one command\non the container and you will not be charged for it. So many commands\nto choose from, which one will you pick? Well the most straightforward\nanswer would be: the command that will run your application!\nRunning your application on Heroku requires explicitly telling the\ncontainer or dyno to run your application. If you take a look at the\nProcfile in your gallery app you will see how this command is instructed\nto run.\nThe Procfile specifies a process of type “web”, which Heroku specifies\nto be the only process type that can accept HTTP traffic, which is\nnecessary for your application to be properly hosted. The command that\nis being run on the Heroku virtual dyno is bundle exec rackup config.ru\nwith a specified port, shown by -p and the variable $PORT.\nThis command will automatically configure a web server with the config.ru\nspecifications that will run on the $PORT port.\nYou can see here that config.ru loads the entire contents of the app\nfolder which contains the gallery application. It also fires up Sinatra\nto run the application, as seen on line 2.\nSo now you can see how Heroku is able to know what to do with your code\nwhen you push it.\nHeroku is able to recognize the Procfile as a file that will specify\na process to run on the dyno. You can see in the terminal output of your\nHeroku push. It is important to reiterate the the command in the Procfile\nis not being run on your local environment, it is running on the\nproduction dyno where your application is hosted.\nThis is a key difference between running your app locally and hosting it\non Heroku. If you were running this application locally, all you would\nhave to do is run ruby app.rb to fire up the server and get your\napplication running. The Procfile is specifically included so that\nHeroku knows what to do with the code you gave it.\nEphemeral Filesystem\nHeroku works on a short-lived file system. It means that any files which\nare not the part of source code will be removed periodically. Does this\nmean that it is not possible to have persistance files on your server?\nNo, you just have to add the database.\nSetting up a Database\nThe repository you cloned in Lesson 1 contained multiple branches that\nrepresent different stages of the application. For this step you will\nneed to create a new local branch within your repository and set it to\nbe track the remote “pg” branch. To do this make sure that you are in\nyour repository and run git checkout -b pg origin/pg.\nWe named this branch is called “pg” because the database that we have\nis a PostgreSQL database. There are many databases out there that you\ncan use but Heroku requires that you use PostgreSQL when using a Ruby\napplication. Sinatra doesn’t require any database by default but other\nframeworks like Rails come with SQLite as a default. SQLite will create\na database file in your application directory that will change as your\ndatabase updates. Because of Heroku’s ephemeral filesystem this changing\ndatabase file will be eventually reset, meaning it is unsuitable for use\nwith Heroku.\nAt this point your application is ready to be deployed, however unless\nyou have PostgreSQL installed in your computer you will not be able to\nrun this application in your localhost. If you do not have PostgreSQL\ninstalled follow these guides.\n\nMac: Visit http://postgresapp.com/\nWindows: Visit http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/\nUbuntu: Visit http://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/\n\nYou may notice when opening this up in your editor that there are many\nmore files present than there were in the version without a database.\nThis is because to get a database working with this Sinatra application\nyou have to have not only the database but also a way for your\napplication to interact with the database, in this case ActiveRecord.\nActiveRecord is an ORM or Object Relational Manager that will translate\nthe ruby code to SQL (pronounced sequel) that the database can execute.\nActiveRecord comes in the form of a gem so you want to make sure that\nthe application is stable locally before it can be deployed online, so\nrun bundle install.\nNow that the required gems are installed on your local system, open\nthe app as you regularly would on your local development environment.\nRun ruby app.rb. When you try to open the application by visiting\nlocalhost:4567 you see that we have a Sinatra error.\n\n  \n\nHere we see that the table that needs to be in the database does not\nyet exist. You need to create it. Return to the command line, shut the\nserver down and run rake db:migrate.\nNow that you have created the table required, go ahead and fire up the\nserver again with ruby app.rb and navigate to it on your browser.\nTo push your pg branch to the Heroku remote make sure that you are\non the pg branch (you can check by running git branch) and run this\ncommand: git push heroku HEAD:master.\nThis command will ensure that the code that is pushed to heroku master\nis the one that is at HEAD. In this case, this is the pg branch.\nOnce you do this open the application by running heroku open.\n\n  \n\nYou will see that we get an internal server error. Well if you recall,\nwhen running the application locally you had to run the database\nmigrations. To run a command on your Heroku server you have to prepend\nthe command with heroku run. This will tell Heroku that you want to\nrun a command on the live server, much like you would when you are\nrunning it on localhost. So instead of rake db:migrate, try heroku run rake db:migrate.\nWell that’s strange, it looks different than the different error you\ngot last time about the undefined PG table. It looks here that Heroku\nis not able to find a database connection.\nThis happened because you do not have a PostgreSQL addon included in\nHeroku. Heroku will only automatically include the PostgreSQL addon\nif your very first deploy includes the gem pg in the Gemfile. This\nis your second deploy to the same Heroku application so it is not\nincluded. To include this addon run\nheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql.\nNow try running the database migrations again in the Heroku server by\nusing heroku run heroku run rake db:migrate.\nNote: Here you might get an error like\nCannot run more than 1 Free size dynos. This is because you already\nhave a service running on a dyno and you need to shut it down first\nbefore trying to create the database.\nGreat it looks like you’re almost there. Check if your page is up by\nrefreshing it.\nYou have now successfully deployed the version of the Udacity Gallery\napplication with a database!\nLet’s recap the takeaways here:\n\nRunning commands on your Heroku server is different than running those same commands on your local computer.\n\nPrepend your commands with heroku run.\n\n\nInstalling a database on your Heroku server is not always automatic.\n\nIf your first deploy contains the pg gem, then Heroku will\ninclude the heroku-postgresql addon.\nIf your application does not start with a postgres database\nbut you want to add it you must run the\nheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql.\n\n\n\nLog Intro\nThe heroku app just shows Internal Server Error when we didn't run the\nmigrations but the local environment showed a detailed output of the error.\nThis is because of:\n\nWe want to hide complex errors from users.\nThe errors might give out sensitive data which can be pose security\nissues.\n\nLog Types\nIf you run into error into the production server, you have to use\nHeroku Logplex which is a collection of log output from different places.\nThe types of logs are:\n\n\nApplication Logs:\n\nDeployed application logs\nSame as your command line\nMirrors development environment\n\n\n\nSystem Logs:\n\nWhat Heroku is doing\nRouting\nStarting/Stopping the dyno\n\n\n\nAdministrative Logs:\n\nAdministrative actions\nRake tasks\nNew build\n\n\n\nIt is very important to know where the error occurred and thus we should\nbe able to read the log output nicely and be able to differentiate between\nthe types of log outputs.\nLog Structure\nheroku logs will give the log output. This output can be divided into four\nparts namely timestamp, app/heroku (who is doing that thing), dyno, and\nfinally the log message.\nOne can use heroku logs --tail to collect logs in realtime.\nFor a detailed description about heroku logs, visit\nhere.\nEnding note\nHeroku has a problem of file storage which can be fixed by using Amazon\nS3 storage.\nAlso, some interesting topics to look into are:\n\nCreating a staging environment\nScheduling Workers\nContinuous Integration\n\nThis was a wonderful course, and I gained lots of useful information\nabout heroku deployment!\n",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/deploying-with-heroku/",title:"Deploying with Heroku"},"https://bauva.com/blog/hft-firms-profits-commissions/":{body:"In HFT or High Frequency Trading, one buys and sells\nmultiple times within a second. In this a millisecond delay can affect\nyour profits adversely and make the algorithm bizarre. The best selling\npoint of an HFT firm is that it can never go in loss. All HFT firms have\nhad only good trading days, the only bad days where when their computer\nsystems had some technical glitches. Needless to say, HFT are not affected\nby the mood swings of the market but instead they just profit like\nbrokerages. In fact, the way their algorithms work for profits are exactly\nlike commission business except that their commissions are big fat\npaychecks. Now let's describe how all this happens. Each part is important\nto the whole story so please bear with me, if it seems a long post.\nNote: Everything written is a very simplistic model. In order to get\naccurate information, please read the books given at the end.\nA little back story\nLong back in the days when trading was manually done by going to exchanges\nand trading your shares there, brokerages would have very high commissions\nbecause they enjoyed some kind of monopoly and it was time consuming. As\ntime passed by, brokerage fees has reduced to a minimum because with\ntechnology, it is possible to handle a very huge amount of trades and its\nno longer a monopoly business. Somewhere just after the financial crisis\nof 2008, a new concept named HFT or High Frequency Trading came which\njust changed trading forever.\nWhat actually happens at Exchanges and Brokerages\nNow let's say a company issues 1,00,00,000 shares in an IPO and registers\nitself with the exchanges and every share gets sold in the IPO. Now if\nyou want to buy some shares, you can only do it when another person wants\nto sell them. Now these exchanges are basically a place where you can\nswap shares with another person using money. To go in more details about\nhow it functions, exchanges maintain a bid/offer stack for each company\nregistered with them. Bid means the\nprice one offers to buy a stock while offer is the price in which one\nwants to sell the stock.\nNow when a retail trader goes to buy a stock, he\nhas to go through his broker which has a line connection to the exchange.\nSo when the retail trader puts an \"buy order\" with the broker, the broker\nforwards the buy order, let's say 1000 shares at Rs. 100 for company A.\nNow instantly the person won't get the shares he demanded because there\nis no one wiling to sell in the market. Now let's say another participant\ncomes to the market which puts a sell order of company A of 2000 shares\nat Rs. 120 . Now even other market participants will enter this market\nand all of them will come to a price equilibrium by the rules of supply\nand demand which is very nicely explained by John Geanakoplos in his\ncourse Financial Theory at\nYale University in the lecture\nWhy Finance? with\nan experiment. It is highly recommended to watch it in order to understand.\nNow the stack with many trades might look like:\nActionQuantityPrice\nBid1000100\nOffer2000120\nBid200110\nBid500112\n\nNow the exchanges' job is to match up the trades. So the bid offer of 500\nshares at Rs. 112 will be matched up, then 200 shares at 110 and then 1000\nat 100. Of course this is a very simplistic view of the markets and because\nof the shear amount of trades happening at the exchanges, the gap is in\ndecimal points and not this huge. An interesting fact to note would be\nthat this gap is also governed by supply and demand. In normal market\nconditions where people are willing to buy and sell shares, the difference\nwould be in decimals while in the financial crisis where everyone was\nwiling to sell and no one to buy a dying company, the differences were\nhuge.\nI know, you would have thought it as some complicated machinery of\nmathematical formulas which would be governing the stock prices but instead\nthese trades are exactly similar like when you go and try to buy things\nfrom the road side dealer. One can even bargain by putting and order and\ncancelling it when a suitable price is not found. It is the job of\nbrokerages to put up the order at exchanges, and see whether a good deal is\nfound. It is the job of exchanges to match buyers with sellers.\nNow in this, one can be confused as to if this is how exchanges work then\nhow can the exchanges show the price of shares as a fixed number. Well,\nif one notices carefully they specifically mention that this is the\naverage price. What it means is that let's say in 1 second equal stocks\nwhere bought/sold at 100, 102, 101 then a weighted average would be 101\nwhich will be showed as the average price the onces which you usually see\non your brokerage screens or NDTV.\nNow that we have a highly simplistic but still accurate model of how\nexchanges and brokerages work, lets dive deeper.\nTrading before there was HFT\nLet's take a simple example of apples. You are organising a party and you\nneed 1000 apples. Now there are two markets in your locality. You take\nyour car and go to market A and see that only 200 apples are available\nat Rs. 10, so you buy them but you still have 800 apples to buy more,\nso you take your car and then go to market B where there are 900 apples\navailable at Rs. 10.50, so you finish your order by buying 800 more apples.\n\n  \n\nTrading after HFT\nLet's continue the simple example of apples. When you go to the market A\nand see buy 200 apples while you still have 800 to buy, a rat comes to know\nabout this and before you get into car and go to the next market, that rat\ngoes to the market B buys all the apples at Rs. 10.50 and before you arrive\nthere it offers to sell at Rs. 11 .\n\n  \n\nPutting it all together\nHFT firms are like rats. They have a privileged connection between two\nexchanges which is faster than any other route. The exchanges flash the\nbuy/sell stack to them. If you carefully see, the only ones at a loss are\nthe normal market participants. The rat eat away some money from the\nmarket participant and this profit is not subject to any market risks.\nThis is purely like commissions without giving service. It is because\nof this that HFT's can't go in loss. They are just not exposed to the\nrise and falls of the bare market.\nIn fact with this example one can also understand how this trading game\nis a zero-sum game which doesn't create an economic value for the society.\nWell these days HFT trading is gone far. There are algorithms to predict\nwhat algorithms are doing but thats a story of another time!\nClick here to read the medium article.\nTo know more read the books,\nTrading and Exchanges\nby Larry Harris and\nFlash Boys\nby Michael Lewis.\n",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/hft-firms-profits-commissions/",title:"HFT firms' profits are like commissions"},"https://bauva.com/blog/intro-to-crypto-and-cryptocurrencies/":{body:"Week 1: Introduction\nCryptographic Hash Functions\nA cryptographic function is a mathematical function which can take any\nstring as input, it produces a fixed sized output and it can be computed\nefficiently.\nProperties required:\n\nIt should be collision-free\nhiding property\npuzzle-free\n\nHash Property 1: Collision Free\nNobody can find x and y such that\n$ x!= y $ and\n$ H(x) = H(y) $. When we say\ncollision free, we don't mean there exists 0 collisions but instead we\nwant it such that nobody can find it.\nWhy collisions exists?\nThe possible inputs are a very big set while the possible outputs are a\nquite small set. If we are dealing with 256-bit crypto functions then\nthe input can be anywhere from 1 byte to 1 gigabyte or even more but the\noutput has to be in 256-bits. Thus it gets crowded and there will be\ncollisions, we just have to make sure that it is super difficult to find\nthem.\nHow to find a collision?\nTry $ {2^{130}} $ random chosen inputs and 99.8% chance that two of them will\ncollide. So no matter what the hash function is, it any which takes too\nlonger. Just to give a sense of the numbers, if all current computers in\nthe universe were computing this with combined power right from the start\nof the universe, then the probability of finding a collision would be\naround 1% . It is more likely probable that the earth will be hit by a\nmeteor rather than finding a collision.\nIs there a faster way to find collisions?\nFor some possible hash functions, yes.\nFor others, we don't know of one\nNo hash function has been proved collision-free.\nApplication: Hash as a message digest\nIf we know $ H(x) = H(y) $,\nit's safe to assume that $ x = y $.\nThat means, to recognize a file that we saw before, just remember the its\nhash.\nThis is useful because the hash is small and can be compared more easily.\nHash Property 2: Hiding\nWe want something like this:\nGiven $ H(x) $, it is infeasible to find  $ x $.\nThis property fails when the inputs can be really less, for eg. a coin\ntoss.\nHiding Property:\nIf r is chosen from a probability distribution that has high min-entropy,\nthen given\n$ H(r | x) $\n, it is infeasible to find x.\nHigh min-entropy means that the distribution is \"very spread out\", so that\nno particular value is chosen with more than negligible probability.\nApplication: Commitment\nWant to \"seal a value in an envelope\", and \"open the envelope\" later.\nCommit to a value, reveal it later.\nCommitment API\n$$ (com, key) := commit(msg) $$\n$$ match := verify(com, key, msg) $$\nTo seal $ msg $ in envelope:\n$$ (com, key) := commit(msg) --&gt; publish -&gt; com $$\nTo open envelope:\nPublish $ key $, $ msg $\nanyone can use $ verify() $ to check validity\nSecurity Properties:\nHiding: Given $ com $, infeasible to find $ msg $.\nBinding: Infeasible to find $ msg != msg' $ such that\n$$ verify(commit(msg), msg') == true $$\n$$ commit(msg) := (H(key | msg), key) $$\nwhere key is a random 256-bit value\n$$ verify(com, key, msg) := (H(key | msg) == com) $$\nSecurity Properties:\nHiding: Given\n$ H(key | msg) $\n, infeasible to find\n$ msg $.\nBinding: Infeasible to find $ msg != msg' $ such that\n$ H(key | msg) == H(key | msg') $\nHash Property 3: Puzzle-friendly:\nFor every possible output value y,\nif k is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy, then it is\ninfeasible to find x such that $ H(k | x) = y $.\nApplication: Search Puzzle\nGiven a \"puzzle ID\" id (from high min-entropy distribution), and a target\nset Y:\nTry to find a \"solution\" x such that\n$ H(id | x) \\in Y $\nPuzzle-friendly property implies that no solving strategy is much better\nthan trying random values of x.\nSHA-256 hash function\nTheorem: If c is collision free then the hash function is also collision\nfree.\n\n  \n\nHash Pointers and Data Structures\nHash Pointer is:\n\npointer to where some info is stored\n(cryptographic) hash of the info\n\nIf we have a hash, we can:\n\nask to get the info back\nverify that it hasn't changed\n\n\n  \n\nWe can take any data structure and build it with the help of a hash\npointer.\nLet's take an example of building a linked list. We can build a linked\nlist with the help of a hash pointer like this:\n\n  \n\nIn this kind of a data structure one can add things at the end of the list\nbut if somebody wants to modify a previously stored list, then it is not\npossible. This is because let's say, you change the data of one element,\nnow the hash that is stored in the pointer will mis-match to the one\nactually stored and thus we can get notified of any tampering. Well we can\ntechnically change the hash pointer to which it points but then the hash\nof that particular element and thus a chain reaction will change and then\nat the end head of the list would need to be changed which is not possible.\nWe can also bring a binary tree with the help of a hash pointer. This is\ncommonly known as \"Merkele Tree\".\n\n  \n\nIt is very easy to even verify the data that we have and the time\ncomplexity of the algorithm will be\n$ \\Theta(\\log n) $\nAdvantages of Merkle Tree\n\nTree holds many items but just need to remember the root hash\nCan verify membership in\n$ \\Theta(\\log n) $ time/space\n\nVariant: sorted Merkle Tree\n\nCan verify non-membership in\n$ \\Theta(\\log n) $ time/space\n\nMore generally, we can use hash pointers in any pointer-based data\nstructure that has no cycles.\nDigital Signatures\nWe want digital signatures such that only one person can sign but anyone\ncan verify. Signature is tied to a particular document and can't be\ncut-and-pasted to another doc.\nAPI for Digital Signatures\n$$ (sk, pk) := generateKeys(keysize) $$\n$$ sig := sign(sk, message) $$\n$$ isValid := verify(pk, message, sig) $$\nwhere,\n$ sk $: secret signing key\n$ pk $: public verification key\nRequirements\n\nSignatures should be able to be verified:\n$$ verify(pk, message, sign(sk, message)) == true $$\nSignatures should not be forged. A person who knows you public key\nshould not be able to produce a verifiable signature on another\nmessage.\n\nPractical things which need to be taken care of\n\nAlgorithms are randomized so we need a good source of randomness\nlimit on message size. fix: use Hash(message) rather than message\nfun trick: sign a hash pointer, signature \"covers\" the whole structure\n\nBitcoin things\nBitcoin uses ECDSA standard. ECSDA stands for Elliptic Curve Digital\nSignature Algorithm which relies on hairy math.\nGood randomness is essential for the proper functioning of ECDSA or one\nwill probably leak your private key.\nPublic Keys as Identities\nOne useful trick out of this is that a public key is considered as\nequivalent as an identity. If we see a signature that we can verify with\na public key then that particular individual is saying that message. If\nwe know the secret key along with the private key, then one can sign\nmessages on behalf of that person.\nHow to make a new identity\nCreate a new, random key-pair (sk, pk) where $ pk $\nis the public \"name\" you can use (usually better to use\n$ Hash(pk) $).\n$ sk $ lets you \"speak for\" the identity\nYou can control the identity, because only you know\n$ sk $ if\n$ pk $ \"looks random\", nobody needs to know who you are\nThis brings us to the idea of decentralized identity management\nDecentralized identity management\nAnybody can make a new identity at any time and one can make as many as\ndesired! And the best part is there is no central point of cooridination.\nThese identities are called \"addresses\" in Bitcoin.\nPrivacy\nAddresses not directly connected to real-world identity. But observer can\nlink together an address's activity over time, make inferences.\nA Simple Cryptocurrency\nGoofy Coin\nLet's take the simple example of Goofy coin.\nGoofy can create new coins. When Goofy creates a coin, it belongs to him.\nNow that coin will be signed by Goofy by the method CreateCoin[uniqueID].\nA coin's owner can spend it. Now Goofy has to give it to Alice so it\ncreates a data structure pointing to Alice's public key\nand Goofy signs it. Now Alice is able to present the whole data structure\nand prove that Goofy gave it to her. Now Alice can pass it again to Bob.\n\n  \n\nGoofy coin is insecure in the way that it doesn't take care of the\ndouble spending problem. Now in this Goofy can give the coin to many people\nand the other person won't ever know whether that coin has been given to\nsomeone else or not. This is the main design challenge in digital currency.\n\n  \n\nScrooge Coin\nScrooge publishes a history of all transactions (a block chain, signed by\nScrooge).\n\n  \n\n$ CreateCoins $ transaction creates new coins. This is valid because\nScrooge said so. In the transaction type, there is a table of coins created\nwhich have the id, value and a recipient address. If Scrooge puts it into\nhistory then it is valid and we don't need to worry.\n\n  \n\n$ PayCoins $ transaction consumes (and destroys) some coins, and creates\nnew coins of the same total value. This is valid if:\n\n  \n\n\nconsumed coins valid\nnot already consumed\ntotal value out = total value in\nsigned by owners of all consumed coins\n\nImmutable coins\nCoins can't be transferred, subdivided into smaller pieces, or combined\ninto a bigger one.\nBut: you can get the same effect by using transactions to subdivide: create\nnew trans. You can consume your coin or pay out two new coins to yourself.\nScrooge coins is still centralized.\nWeek 2: How Bitcoin achieves decentralization\nCentralization vs Decentralization\nThey way bitcoin achieves decentralization is by combination of technical\nand clever incentive engineering.\nDecentralization is not all-or-nothing. Best example is e-mail which is\na decentralized protocol, but dominated by centralized webmail services.\nAspects of decentralization\n\nWho maintains the ledger?\nWho has authority over which transactions are valid?\nWho creates new bitcoins?\nWho determines how the rules of the system change?\nHow do bitcoins acquire exchange value?\n\nBeyond the protocol:\nexchanges, wallet software, service providers ...\nAspects of decentralization in Bitcoin\nPeer-to-Peer network:\n\nopen to anyone, low barrier to entry\n\nMining:\n\nopen to anyone, but inevitable concentration of power\noften seen as undesirable\n\nUpdates to software:\n\ncore developers trusted by community, have great power\n\nDistributed Consensus\nBitcoin's key challenge:\nKey technical challenge of decentralized e-cash: distributed consensus,\nor how to decentralize ScroogeCoin.\nWhy consensus protocols?\nTraditional motivation: reliability in distributed system\nDistributed key-value store enables various applications like DNS,\npublic key directory, stock trades, ... which are all good for altcoins.\nAltcoins: They are systems built on bitcoins like principles to achieve\nslightly different role, sometimes currency systems sometimes not\ncurrency systems.\nDefining distributed consensus\n\nThe protocol terminates and all correct nodes decide on the same\nvalue\nThis value must have been proposed by some correct node\n\nHow distributed consensus works in bitcoin\nWhen Alice wants to pay Bob: she broadcasts the transaction to all\nBitcoin nodes. The transaction has Alice's signature which other nodes\nneed in order to know that it came from Alice, it will also contain\nBob's public key which is his address at where he wants to receive the\nbitcoin and further it contains a hash. This hash is a way for Alice\nto link together this transaction or this coin to her receipt of this\ncoin from someone else.\n\n  \n\nNote: In this, Bob is not in this picture. If Bob wants to be notified\nthat this transaction has in fact happened then he might want to run a\npeer-to-peer node on the network in order to listen and be sure that\nhe has received the bitcoins but it is not required since the bitcoins\nwill be his whether he is notified or not.\nWhat do the nodes want to reach a consensus on?\nGiven that a variety of users are broadcasting these transactions to\nthe network, what everybody wants to reach consensus on is exactly which\ntransactions were broadcast and the order in which they happened.\nHow consensus could work in Bitcoin?\nAt any given time:\n\nAll nodes have a sequence of blocks of transactions they have\nreached consensus on\nEach node has a set of outstanding transactions it's heard about\n\n\n  \n\nAlthough this has things similar to bitcoins, this is not how bitcoins\nexactly work. This is because, doing things in this way is a really\nhard technical problem for a variety of reason.\nWhy consensus is hard?\n\nNodes may crash\nNodes may be malicious\nNetwork is imperfect\n\nNot all pairs of nodes connected\nFaults in network\nLatency\n\n\n\nOne particular consequence of high latency is that there is no notion\nof global time. Not all nodes can agree with a particular order of events\njust on basis of timestamps.\nMany impossibility result:\n\nByzantine generals problem\nFischer-Lynch-Paterson (deterministic nodes): consensus impossible\nwith a single faulty node\n\nDespite of these, there are still some well known protocols like Paxos\nwhich can never give inconsistant result but can (rarely) get stuck.\nUnderstanding impossibility results\n\nThese results say more about the model than about the problem\nThe models were developed to study systems like distributed databases.\n\nBitcoin consensus works better in practice than in theory. Theory is\nstill catching up. BUT theory is important as it can help predict\nunforeseen attacks.\nSome things Bitcoin does differently:\n\nIntroduces incentives: Possible only because it's a currency!\nEmbraces randomness:\n\nDoes away with the notion of a specific end-point\nConsensus happens over long time scales - about 1 hour\nGives a probabilistic model about the verification of transaction\nover time with exponential growth.\n\n\n\nConsensus without identity: The Block Chain\nWhy identity?\nPragmatic: some protocols need node IDs\nSecurity: assume less than 50% malicious\nWhy don't Bitcoins nodes have identities?\n\nIdentity is hard in a P2P sytem - Sybil attack\nPseudonymity is a goal of Bitcoin\n\nKey Idea: Implicit Consensus\nIn each round, random node is picked. This node proposes the next block\nin the chain.\nOther nodes implicitly accept/reject this block:\n\nby either extending it\nor ignoring it and extending chain from earlier block\n\nEvery block contains hash of the block it extends.\nConsensus Algorithm (simplified)\n\nNew transactions are broadcast to all nodes\nEach node collects new transactions into a block\nIn each round a random node gets to broadcast its block\nOther nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are\nvalid (unspent, valid signatures)\nNodes express their acceptance of the block by including its hash\nin the next block they create\n\nWhat can a malicious node do?\nWhat can't an attacker not do?\n\nIt can't forge a signature thus it can't spend the Bitcoin on behalf\nof the original owner\nWhile it can purposely choose to ignore verifying a transaction which\ncan cause delays but then that transaction will be taken up by some\nother node and thus it can be signed.\n\nDouble Spending Attack:\nWhen Alice pays Bob a Bitcoin, that means she will create a transaction\nfrom her address to Bob's public address. She broadcasts it to the\nnetwork and let's say some honest node creates this block, listens to\nthe transaction and includes it in that block.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nSummarizing:\n\nProtection against invalid transactions is cryptographic, but enforced\nby consensus\nProtection against double-spending is purely by consensus\nYou're never 100% sure a transaction is in consensus branch. Guarantee\nis probabilistic\n\nIncentives and Proof of Work\nAssumption of honesty is problematic.\nCan we give nodes incentives for behaving honestly?\n\n  \n\nIncentive 1: block reward\nCreator of block gets to\n\ninclude special coin-created transaction in the block\nchoose recipient address of this transaction\n\nValue is fixed: current 25 BTC, halves every 4 years\nBlock creator gets to \"collect\" the reward only if the block ends up on\nlong-term consensus branch!\nThere's a finite supply of Bitcoins\n\n  \n\nIncentive 2: transaction fees\n\nCreator of transaction can choose to make output value less than\ninput value\nRemainder is a transaction fee and goes to the block creator\nPurely voluntary, like a tip\n\nRemaining Problems\n\nHow to pick a random node?\nHow to avoid a free-for-all due to rewards?\nHow to prevent Sybil attacks?\n\nThe solution to the problems is Proof of Work.\nProof of Work\nTo approximate selecting a random node: select  nodes in proportion to\na resource that no one can monopolize (we hope)\n\nIn proportion to computing power: proof-of-work\nIn proportion to ownership: proof-of-stake\n\nEquivalent views of proof of work\n\nSelect nodes in proportion to computing power\nLet nodes compete for right to create block\nMake it moderately hard to create new identities\n\nProof of work in Bitcoin\nHash Puzzles\n\n  \n\nPoW property 1: difficult to compute\nIt takes around\n$ 10^{ 20 } $ hashes/block\nPoW property 2: parameterizable cost\nNodes automatically re-calculate the target every two weeks\nGoal: average time between blocks = 10 mins\nThis means that the next time one tries to hash a block is not just\ndependent on it's own computing power but it mainly depends on the\ncomputing power of other people. To tell it more subtly:\nProb(Alice wins next block) = fraction of global hash power she controls\nKey security assumption:\nAttacks infeasible if majority of miners weighted by hash power follow\nthe protocol.\nSolving hash puzzles is probabilistic:\n\n  \n\nPoW property 3: trivial to verify\nNonce must be published as part of block.\nOther miners simply verify that\n$$ H(nonce || prevhash || tx || ... || tx) &lt; target $$\nPutting It All Together\nMining Economics\n$$ Profit = reward - hardware - electricity $$\nComplications:\n\nfixed vs. variable costs\nreward depends on global hash rate\n\nSummary:\n\nIdentities\nTransactions\nP2P network\nBlock chain &amp; consensus\nHash Puzzles &amp; Mining\n\nBitcoin is bootstrapped\nThere is a circle of dependency between security of block chain,\nhealth of mining ecosystem, and value of currency.\n\n  \n\nIt is a very tricky process as to how all of these three things were\nacquired by the Bitcoin system in an interdependent manner. It was of\ncourse fueled by media.\nWhat can a \"51% attacker\" can do?\nSteal coins from existing address? NO\nSuppress some transactions?\n\nFrom the block chain, yes\nFrom the P2P network, no\n\nChange the block reward? No\nDestroy confidence in Bitcoin? YES\nWeek 3\nBitcoin Transactions\nAn account-based Ledger (not Bitcoin)\nIf we use an account based ledger wherein we store all the trades that can\nhappen then we have something like this:\n\n  \n\nAlthough the problem with this is that to verify that when the person\nwho promises to pay is a big pain because for that we would have to\ntraverse the whole history of all transactions. In this system there is\nno way of storing the amount of money a person owns and thus calculating\nthe whole list every time a transaction is made is just too much\ncomputationally intensive. If we try to maintain an account of each person,\nthen it would be a sophisticated data structure which would be different\nfrom the original block chain.\nA transaction-based Ledger\nBitcoin uses something like this.\n\n  \n\nThe first transaction depicts the creation of a new currency. In the second\ntransaction, the coins are split into two, Bob is given 17 coins\nwhile Alice is given 8 coins by herself where,\n$$ 17 + 8 = 25 $$. So this is called as change address because the address\nof the transactions owned by Alice have changed. The point is that\nthe transaction totally consumes the full money of the previous block.\nThus it is easy to maintain the transactions as well as the amount of money\nowned by each person.\nA real deal: A Bitcoin Transaction\n\n  \n\nThree parts:\n\nMetadata\nInputs\nOutputs\n\nMetadata: Some housekeeping information like size of the transactions,\nnumber of inputs and the number of outputs. There is the hash of the\nentire transaction, and there is a lock-time parameter.\nInput: It is an array that have inputs of the same form. The inputs\nspecify a previous transaction specifically so they have the hash or\nhash pointer to it and the index of which transaction which you are\nactually claiming and after that there is a signature.\nOutputs: They have a value of a coin and then there is a recipient\naddress.\nBitcoin Scripts\nEach transaction output doesn't just specify a simple public key, but\ninstead it specifies a script.\nAn Example\nOutput \"addresses\" are really scripts. The most common script in bitcoin\nis to redeem a previous transaction by signing with the correct public\nkey. This is what an output address would look like in a script:\nOP_DUP\nOP_HASH160\n69e02e18...\nOP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\nInput \"address\" is also a script. So that's a bit of a script that you\ncombine with the output script by concatenation and that gets you a script\nthat you have to run successfully to claim a bitcoin.\nTo Verify: Concatenated script must execute completely with no errors.\nBitcoin Scripting Language\nDesign goals:\n\nBuilt for Bitcoin (inspired by Forth)\nSimple, compact\nSupport for cryptography\nStack-based\nLimits on time/memory\nNo looping\n\nThis is not a turing complete language. No looping is there to protect\nthe miner from infinite looping submitted by malicious nodes.\nBitcoin Script Execution Example\nA stack based data structure is the most suitable when you have to\nperform operations on data. Bitcoin scripting also uses the same. When it\nsees a data value, it pushes it on top of the stack. When it sees an\noperation, then it pops the top value of the stack performs the operation\nand then pushes the output on the top of the stack back.\nLet's say you want to execute this script:\n&lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubKey&gt; OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubKeyHash?&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\n\nSo the execution will start with pushing &lt;sig&gt; into the stack and then\n&lt;pubKey&gt;.\nStack\n&lt;pubKey&gt;\n&lt;sig&gt;\n\nAfter that, the operation is OP_DUP which is to duplicate the top of\nthe stack. So after this operation the stack looks like,\nStack\n&lt;pubKey&gt;\n&lt;pubKey&gt;\n&lt;sig&gt;\n\nThen the operation is OP_HASH160 which means to hash the top value of\nthe stack. The stack therefore is,\nStack\n&lt;pubKeyHash&gt;\n&lt;pubKey&gt;\n&lt;sig&gt;\n\nThen the data value &lt;pubKeyHash?&gt;,\nStack\n&lt;pubKeyHash?&gt;\n&lt;pubKeyHash&gt;\n&lt;pubKey&gt;\n&lt;sig&gt;\n\nThen the operation OP_EQUALVERIFY which pops the two topmost elements\nand then verifies whether the both are equal, if equal then it removes\nboth the values from the stack, otherwise it terminates the execution\nof the script with a negative response for verification.\nStack\n&lt;pubKey&gt;\n&lt;sig&gt;\n\nNow OP_CHECKSIG checks whether the signature is valid. It can verify\nsignatures without calling special libraries. The input to the signature\nfunction is the entire transaction. After this the remaining things\nwill be popped out and nothing is left. If we didn't have any errors, then\nthe output is a \"yes\" which means the transaction is valid.\nBitcoin Script Instructions\n256 opcodes total (15 disabled, 75 reserved)\n\nArithmetic\nIf/then\nLogic/data handling\nCrypto!\n\nHashes\nSignature Verification\nMulti-Signature verification\n\n\n\nOP_CHECKMULTISIG:\n\nBuilt-in support for joint signatures\nSpecify n public keys\nSpecify t\nVerification requires t signatures\n\nBitcoin scripts in practice (as of 2014)\n\nMost nodes whitelist known scripts\n99.9% are simple signature checks\n~0.01% are MULTSIG\n~0.01% are Pay-to-Script-Hash\nRemainders are errors, proof-of-burn\n\nProof-of-Burn\nIt is a script that can never be redeemed. It is provable that those\ncoins have been destroyed and they can't be spent again. One can use\nOP_RETURN with any arbitrary data and no matter what values you put in\nbefore, they get permanently stored in the chain.\nShould Sender specify scripts?\nIdeally all senders have to send scripts, but this creates a lot of\nconfusion for the user. So a simple hack is to use the hash of a\nredemption script. The sender doesn't need to specify the entire script\nbut the sender can specify the hash of the script needed to be redeem\nthose coins.\nApplication of Bitcoin Scripts\nEscrow Transactions\nProblem\nLet's say Alice sells a big order for apples to Bob. Now Alice doesn't\nwant to pay until Bob delivers the apples and Bob doesn't want to\ndeliver the apples until Alice pays for it.\nSolution\nTo solve this problem, we introduce a third party. Alice can create a\nMULTISIG transaction that requires two or three people to sign to\nredeem the transaction. So now Alice pays 2-of-3 of Alice, Bob and Judy\n(MULTISIG) and in this point the coins are held in the escrow and the\ntwo can specify where the coins should go. Bob will be satisfied that\nhe is safe sending the goods to Alice, thus he will deliver the apples.\nThen Alice wants to pay Bob for his services, so to release the money\nfrom the escrow and pay to Bob, they both can sign a transaction releasing\nredeeming the coins from escrow and sending them to Bob and the great\nthing is that Judy had to never get involved. This requires one extra\ntransaction on the block chain.\nWhat if Bob didn't send or sent faulty goods? Now Alice doesn't want to\npay Bob. In this case, Bob won't sign the transaction because he wants\nto defy the claim. So in this case Judy involves and helps in settling\nthe dispute. Judy can sign the transaction in whichever direction she\nwants and thus after obtaining 2 signatures, the coins can be transferred\neasily.\nGreen Addresses\nProblem\nAlice wants to pay Bob. Bob can't wait 6 verifications to guard against\ndouble spends, or is offline completely. So Bob can't go to the block\nchain and verify the transaction.\nSolution\nTo solve this, we need to introduce one bank. Alice pays the bank with\nthe coins. Now this bank has the trust of the people that it never double\nspends and in return it takes a small part of the transaction. Now\nwhen Bob comes online, it can immediately ask the bank to pay him the\ncoins. This idea puts too much trust on the bank and they have\nhistorically failed.\nEfficient micro-payments\nProblem\nAlice wants to pay Bob for each minute of phone service. She doesn't want\nto incur a transaction fee every minute. Since the fees are quite low,\nthe transaction costs would seem quite high in comparison.\nSolution\nWe can club together many small payments into one payment. We start with\na MULTISIG transaction with an amount which is the highest Alice is\ngoing to pay which will be signed by Alice and Bob. The first payment\nis then done by Alice to Bob while returning the rest remaining coins\nto herself. After next service Alice signs another transaction in which\nshe signs coins for both of the services while paying rest to her. Alice\nwill keep sending these transaction to Bob as long as she is using the\nservice. These aren't getting published in the block chain but is there\nwith Bob. When Alice stop using the service, Bob will take the last\ntransaction (which has the highest coins). So technically all of those\ntransactions are double-spend.\n\n  \n\nWhat is Bob never signs the last transaction?\nNow the coins won't move but Alice will be out of coins she initially\ndeposited. To avoid this, we use lock time. Alice can put up a\ntransaction saying \"Pay 100 to Alice, LOCK until time t\" which is to be\nsigned by Alice and Bob. The metadata parameter lock_time is used to\nspecify this, and if contains a non-zero value then the transaction\ncan't be published until some time specified by that value in future.\n\n  \n\nMore Advanced Scripts\n\nMultiplayer Lotteries\nHash pre-image challenges\nCoin Swapping protocols\n\nThe name for these kind of things is called \"smart contracts\".\nBitcoin Blocks\nWhy bundle transactions together?\n\nSingle unit of work for miners\nLimit length of hash-chain of blocks\n\nFaster to verify history\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nThe real deal\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\nThe Bitcoin Network\nThe Bitcoin P2P Network\n\nAd-hoc protocol (runs on TCP port 83330)\nAd-hoc network with random topology\nAll nodes are equal\nNew nodes can join at any time\nForget non-responding nodes after 3 hr\n\nJoining the Bitcoin P2P network\nWhen you launch a new node and try to connect to a network, you start\nwith a simple message to one node that you know about.

It is as if virtual things came to life.\nAfter being extremely enthusiastic about this I searched about it more\nand found that Udacity is offering the course named as Introduction\nTo Virtual Reality.\nSo I decided to take that course. There have been some discussions in\nour Robotix group about buying a VR development\nheadset and starting off a project under our makerspace labs. Since I am\npretty keen about this, I thought of taking the udacity course so that\nI have a solid idea about what VR actually is and what all it takes to\nhave a successful VR project before just jumping about in \"coolness\".\nNote: What follows after this is kind of like class notes for the above\nlisted Udacity course.\nWhat is VR?\nPrinciples of VR\nWhat makes VR, actually VR? The common features of VR devices include\na pair of lenses, a high definition display, tracking hardware. But is\nthe hardware it for VR? Nope, VR is all about creating a synthetic virtual\nworld which requires smooth working of several hardware and software\nsystems not just a headset.\nThere are various aspects in Virtual Reality\nlike optics, displays, tracking, performance, and many more.\nOptics\nSince virtual reality headsets are held pretty close to the eye, it\nbecomes really tough to actually see the image. That is the reason\nlenses are required. Lenses help to focus the light directly into the\nretina from a near eyed object. The image would also look magnified after\ngoing through the lenses. We can actually see individual pixels. Each\nmanufacturer has to make the best trade-off between the field of view,\nfocal length, optical distortion and finally cost. The lenses reduce the\napparent resolution of the VR display and they increase the distortions\nin the VR display.\nDisplays\nThese displays should have very high resolution because the lenses magnify\nthem and image resolution finally decreases when they hit the retina.\nIdeally, resolution of the display should be around 160,000 by 160,000\nfor a full HD view but right now we haven't achieved that stage and it\nis a long way to go.\nThe second most important component is having the display with low\npersistance. It means that instead of showing the full image, it only\nshows you a part of the image at a given time. Now the question arises,\nWhy is it necessary?.\nLow persistence is necessary because it eliminates motion blur which\nkeeps the image clear from ground and also keeps it from smearing together.\nLow persistence hides the pixels while they effectively change colour. This\ngives us sharp, consistant and believable images.\nTracking\nTracking allows the headset to know where you are in space. Most of the\nVR headsets rely on IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). It enables high\nspeed rotational tracking. Unfortunately they can't tell where the object\nis located, but can only give information about rotation.\nIMUs employ variety of positional tracking techniques like camera, lasers,\nprecise clocks, magnetic fields, etc. This is an area of active research.\nChallenges\nThe biggest challenge that VR faces is simulator sickness. Some VR devices\ngive you headaches and make you feel dizzy.\nWhat makes people uncomfortable?\nPretty much anything that is mis-matched between the body's internal sense\nof motion and the data brain receives from your visual system. So if what\nyou see doesn't line up with what body feels, one can feel uncomfortable.\nPlatforms and Paradigms\nMajor VR Platforms\nThere is a major explosion of VR companies in recent times. The major are:\n\nSony PlayStation VR\nHTC Vive\nOculus Rift\nSamsung Gear VR\nGoogle Daydream View\n\n3-DOF vs 6-DOF\nDOF means Degree of Freedom. The 3-DOF VR devices can only tell where\nyou are looking while the 6-DOF VR devices can tell where you are looking\nas well as your current location in 3D space.\n3-DOF tracks the rotations along the X, Y and the Z axis.\n6-DOF tracks the rotations along the X, Y and the Z axis. On top of that\nit can also track the position along X, Y and Z axis.\nHow IMUs Enable 3-DOF Tracking\nA very popular IMU is the Sparkfun 9-DOF Razor IMU\nwhich has a gyroscope, accelerometer and a magnetometer in built. It takes\ndata from all of those, performs fancy math and then gives us all the\nfinal data for the 9-DOF system.\nSometimes this IMU is in the phone and some times in the headset but no\nmatter what a VR system requires a IMU.\nMajor 6-DOF Tracking System\nLet's see how the two major players do it.\n\n\nOculus Rift: It uses a tracking system called\nConstellation. Rift has a\nlarge number of infrared LEDs. Each LED is blinking very very fast. There\nis also a separate camera placed on the desk or somewhere nearby. The\ncamera catches these light patterns and the computer builds up a model.\nThe program then tries to fit the 3D model it gets into the 2D model.\nBy doing all of this, it can calculate all the data required for tracking\n6-DOF system.\n\n\nHTC Vive: It uses\nLightHouse\ntracking system. Unlike Rift, this one uses infrared lasers. It measures\nthe time it takes to sweep the lazer horizontally and vertically to\ndetermine the location of the headset. This is a similar technique like\nlight houses which help ships navigate successfully by using time\nmeasurements and by using an embedded IMU.\n\n\nDifferences between mobile and desktop VR\nMobileDesktop\nIMU TrackingOptical &amp; IMU Tracking\nUntetheredTethered\nLess powerfulMore powerful\nNo additional hand controllerHand controller\n\nVR Development Platform\nVR applications are easy to develop with the help of Game Engine softwares\nlike Unity which is a combination of both Code +\nEditor so as to reduce efforts and time.\nA typical game engine often provides:\n\n3D Rendering\nPhysics\nSound\nScripting\nAnimation\nAsset Management\nAnd more...\n\nThere are many other game engines like\nUnreal Game Engine,\nCryEngine,\nLumberyard in the market.\nThere are various native development tools which can be used like C++,\nOpenGL, DirectX if you don't want to use a game engine. The major\nadvantage of using these are very customizability but then one can to\ncompromise on development time which can get pretty long. These set of\ntools are more useful when you are developing framework which others can\nuse.\nThere is also WebVR but unfortunately it isn't\nthat powerful and missed on many features and is currently still under\nheavy development. Maybe in future it can be used.\nThe further course now touches how to use the Unity3D platform to develop\nVR applications.\nThis course was pretty interesting and I got to know some really good\ninsights on what VR actually is. I think I will do more research about this\nand try and build a simple application on Unity3D before buying out the\nVR headset!\n",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/introduction-to-virtual-reality/",title:"Introduction to Virtual Reality"},"https://bauva.com/blog/single-view-stereo/":{body:"Stereo Vision is traditionally done with the help of two cameras which\ntake images simultaneously. Me and\nShivang Agarwal thought of working on\nSingle View Stereo or Monocular Stereo Vision\nfor Swarm Robotics as the starting point\nof something called as \"Distributed Vision\". More about distributed vision\nin a future post.\nThe Problem\nTraditionally stereo vision (generating disparity maps) is achieved by\nusing two synchronized cameras taking the pictures at the same time and\nin which we know how far the cameras are (the translational matrix $ T $) and\nhow are the cameras orientated with respect to each other (The rotational\nmatrix $ R $) by doing the camera calibration once at the start. Now the\nproblem is that we don't want to use two cameras but we want to achieve\nthe exact same thing using only one camera and the $ R $ and $ T $ matrix change\nwith every set of images and plus for camera calibration we traditionally\nuse chess board in which we know the real world distances, while right\nnow we don't know that. What we intend to do is to take a frame, then\nmove the camera and take another frame. So now we have two images and\ntechnically we can apply stereo vision. The only problem now is that we\ndon't have the $ R $ and $ T $ matrix in this case. So we can't compute the\nfundamental matrix $ F $. We now need to figure out how to find $ F $, $ R $ and $ T $.\nMathematical Theory\nLet's the vector x represent any point in the left image and the vector\nx' represent any point in the right image. The matrix relation between\nthese is:\n\\begin{equation}\nx^T F x' = 0\n\\end{equation}\nLet this be equation (1).\nAlso let the matrix F be:\n$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\na &amp; b &amp; c\\\nd &amp; e &amp; f\\\ng &amp; h &amp; i\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nSo as of now, the problem boils down to finding a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i.\nNo of distinct points required\nAs the equation (1) suggests, if we have the coordinate of many points\nin left image and their corresponding points in the right image, we can\neasily figure out the value of the matrix F. Let's just start off by\ntaking a single point in the left image $ (x_1, y_1) $\nand the corresponding point in the right image $ (x_1', y_1') $\nOn plugging these values in equation (1), we get\n$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\nx_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; 1\n\\end{array} \\right)\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\na &amp; b &amp; c \\\nd &amp; e &amp; f \\\ng &amp; h &amp; i\n\\end{array} \\right)\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nx_1' \\\ny_1' \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) = 0\n$$\nAfter simplifying, we get\n$$ (x_1x_1')a + (y_1y_1')d + (x_1')g + (x_1y_1')b + (y_1y_1')e + (y_1')h + (x_1)c + (y_1)f + i = 0 $$\nwhere we have 9 unkowns but only one equation. Interestingly if we try for\n9 points, we can have 9 such equtions which can be written as\n$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\nx_1 x_1' &amp; y_1 y_1' &amp; x_1' &amp; x_1 y_1' &amp; y_1 y_1' &amp; y_1' &amp; x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; 1 \\\n... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... &amp; ... \\\nx_9 x_9' &amp; y_9 y_9' &amp; x_9' &amp; x_9 y_9' &amp; y_9 y_9' &amp; y_9' &amp; x_9 &amp; y_9 &amp; 1 \\\n\\end{array} \\right)\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\na \\\nb \\\nc \\\nd \\\ne \\\nf \\\ng \\\nh \\\ni\n\\end{array} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is equation (2).\nwhich is of the form $$ AX = 0 $$. For this system of equations, we\nshould avoid the trivial solution of every variable being zero thus we\nwill only require 8 points.\nNote: We will use SVD to solve this system of equations. While the\nminimum number required is 8, a higher number of points will have high\naccuracy.\nGetting the value of Fundamental matrix F\nThus we can effectively get the solution of this by using just 8 points.\nOn solving, we can easily obtain the values of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and\ni. Please note, it is very essential to make sure that the fundamental\nmatrix is of rank 2 ie. $$ rank(F) = 2 $$.\nGetting the Essential Matrix E\nFundamental matrix F represents the 2D relationship between the point on\nthe left image and the right image while Essential Matrix E tries to\nactually map the relationships in 3D space. In traditional stereo vision,\nfundamental matrix is obtained from essential matrix using,\n$$ F = K^{-T} E K^{-1} $$\nThis is equation (3).\nwhere K is the camera calibration matrix. Using the equation (3) we\ncan easily reverse engineer to get the value of E.\n$$ E = K^T F K $$\nThis is equation (4).\nIt is essential to note here that Essential Matrix also rank 1 ie.\n$ rank(E) = 2 $.\nCalculate Projection\nLet $ P_1 $ and $ P_2 $ be the projection vectors from both the images.\nNow assuming $ P_1 $ to be our reference point, we can get the $ P_2 $ in\nterms of the Rotational Matrix R and T.\n$$\nP_1 = K\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\nI_{3x3} &amp; 0\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equation (5).\n$$\nP_2 = K\n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\nR &amp; T\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equation (6).\nRelation between E, R and T\nNow that we have got E, we can decompose that into R and T. The relation\nbetween these is:\n$$\nE = [ T ]_{\\times} R\n$$\nThis is equation (7).\nNote: Here we take a cross product between the two matrix.\nReconstructing T\nThis can be visualized with the help of Epipolar Geometry. The ray\nbetween the two camera locations plus the rays pointing to the point from\nboth the camera locations form a plane. As you sweep a plane across these,\nall the epilines will converge into a single point a.k.a epipole which\nwill be somewhere in between the line joining the two camera locations.\nWith both the epipoles we can now know the vector T. Because the\nepipole is the projection of the camera location on the image plane of\nthe other camera image on the line joining the two locations, we can say\nthat,\n$$\nP_2\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) = \n\\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\nR &amp; T\n\\end{array} \\right)\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equation (8).\nNow we can also say using the priciples in traditional stereo vision,\n$$ T^T E = 0 $$\nThis is equation (9).\nwhich basically means that left nullspace of the essential matrix is the\nepipole in right image. Thus we can decompose E by using SVD as,\n$$\nE = U\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\n0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equation (10).\nwhere\n$$\nU =\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\nu_1 &amp; u_2 &amp; u_3\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nand thus we can say that $ T = -u_3 $ or $ T = u_3 $ which are two\nvalues.\nReconstructing R\nOnce the value of T is successfully extracted from E matrix, we can\nshow using some linear algebra that\n$$\nR = U\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\\n1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\n\\end{array} \\right)\nV^T\n$$\nThis is equation (11).\nor\n$$\nR = U\n\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\n-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\n0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\n\\end{array} \\right)\nV^T\n$$\nThis is equation (12).\nwhere U and V are matrix found from SVD of E of matrix.\nRemoving Extraneous Values\nSince we are getting two values of R and T, we have total of 4\npermutations of these while only one is valid. Now, it is actually\ninteresting to note what all of these values represent. The correct value\nrepresents the point actually in front of both the images. The other\nvalues represent the point at back in either of the images or both of\nthem. So to get this we can get the 3D location of the point (this is\ncalled as Point Triangulation that we are seeing. If the z-coordinate is\npositive then we have found our correct solution because all other values\nshould be negative since we have assumed left image to be our reference\npoint.\nPoint Triangulation\nWe can get the point triangulation by,\n$$\n\\lambda\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nX \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) = P_1\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nX \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equation (13).\nThis implies that the cross product of two vectors must be zero. Thus,\n$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nX_1 \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) P_1\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nX \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is equation (14).\nAnd,\n$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nX_2 \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) = P_2\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c}\nX \\\n1\n\\end{array} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is equation (15).\nThus we will get the x, y, and z coordinate of all the points. Now we can\ndiscard the solutions by checking their z coordinate as described in the\nabove section.\nNote: To get more accurate values, we can take multiple points and use\nleast squares method to get better results.\nActual Implementation\nGetting corresponding feature points\nAs we said above that we can find the fundamental matrix if we get the\ncorresponding points from both the images, we first need to find all of\nthose points. Technically we need only 8 points to uniquely determine the\nfundamental matrix but since we are dealing with real world coordinates\nfrom camera (which aren't perfect) so we will take as many points as\npossible. We will use linear least square algorithms which can be solved\nusing SVD, with RANSAC to get more accurate results which will work\nbetter with more number of points.\nTo get those points, we can use either SIFT (Scale-invariant Feature\nTransform or ORB (Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF) or DAISY algorithm to\nget the feature points. In this SIFT algorithm is generally more accurate\nbut it takes more computational resources and since we are dealing with\na real time problem, it will be better to use ORB which is fast and\nreliable and comes with opencv unlike Daisy.\nWhy not cv::stereoCalibrate()\nThis function could have been used which does all of our work to\ncalculate the R, T, F, K and E matrix for us but unfortunately we\ncan't use this as we need the corresponding points in the actual 3D world\nthat we are going to pass which we don't know. In traditional stereo\nvision using two cameras, this is not a problem since we use a chessboard\nin which we know the actual world distances between the two points and we\njust do it once so as to get all the values. For our problem, we need to\ncalibrate the cameras again and again for every frames that we take in\nand we won't even know the actual 3D coordinate for the same.\ncv::Mat cv::findFundamentalMat()\n\nwhich takes in two input arrays each of which correspond to their\nrespective points in the left and the right image and gives us\nFundamental Matrix F. This method uses RANSAC to compute the fundamental\nmatrix and gives it to us after cleaning it up so this is finally of\nrank 2 as we require.\nDecomposing $ F $ into $ E $, $ T $, $ P_1 $ and $ P_2 $\nThis is the most challenging part of this problem. We now have F but we\ndon't have E, R, T, $ P_1 $ and $ P_2 $. Unfortunately there is\nno inbuilt method in opencv to actually implement this for us so we will\nhave to type this out all by ourselves. Since we know the mathematics\nbehind it, we can easily use the OpenCV library for linear algebra and\ncompute this. Again in this since we have many points and not just one\nwe will employ SVD algorithm to help us in solving the various matrix\nequations which in turn gives us an approximate solution. While doing\nthis we will have to be careful about which format we choosing our data\nto be because that format has to be compatible with the rest of the\nOpenCV functions as well because we intend to use the other methods in\nOpenCV to simply our job afterwards.\nNote: This gives us 4 values of R and T. We need to remove these by\ntriangulation of points.\nRemoving extra points by triangulation\nAs we mentioned above, we are getting 4 values of R and T while we only\nrequire one. Now we choose a point and try to triangulate it with respect\nto both the image planes so that we can know whether they lie in front of\nthem or at the back. To do this there exists a function named\nvoid cv::triangulatePoints()\n\nwhich reconstructs the point by triangulation. We have mentioned the\nmaths behind it above. It takes Projection Matrix $ P_1 $ and $ P_2 $\nand arrays of points corresponding to each image in two separate arrays\nand outputs the 3D coordinates in a 4D array in which the last one is the\nhomogeneous coordinate. Now we can easily see which points are in the\nfront and thus we can take that particular value of R and T while we\ndiscard the rest.\nImage Rectification parameters\nNow we have all the values that we require but still the images have a\ndefinite epipole. This means that the images aren't exactly \"straight\"\nand thus we will need to straighten this out so that we get epipoles at\ninfinity. The benefit of doing this is that now we will need to search\nfor the corresponding point in the x-coordinate only instead of seaching\nin the whole area. Luckily, we have an opencv function which can do this\nfor us, namely\nvoid cv::stereoRectify()\n\nwhich gives us the new $ R_1 $, $ R_2 $, $ P_1 $ and $ P_2 $ for\neach of the image. The better part about this function is that this can\neven get the value of Q which gives us the relation between the disparity\nmap and the depth map which we will need further to show the image in 3D.\nRectified Image\nNow we have got the rectification parameters. After this we will have to\nmake the corresponding changes in the image according to those parameters.\nLuckily, we have an opencv function namely\nvoid cv::undistortPoints()\n\nwhich maps the initial point coordinates to their final destination\ncoordinates.\nGenerating disparity map with Blob Matching\nNow we can finally the use opencv function,\ncv::StereoBM::StereoBM()\nvoid cv::StereoBM::operator()\n\nwhich operates only on rectified images to generate the disparity map for\nus.\nGetting the depth map\nSince we now have the disparity map and the Q matrix we can easily\ncompute the depth map. Luckily there exists an opencv function for the\nsame namely,\nvoid cv::reprojectImageTo3D()\n\nYou can find the source code for all of this on\ngithub.\n",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/single-view-stereo/",title:"Single View Stereo"},"https://bauva.com/blog/writing-kickass-readmes/":{body:"Writing documentation for code is extremely important.

In the latter case, it would be\nworth while to mention all of the dependencies required.

And that's not it, your README should\nexplicitly point out to the documentation and also tell the user how\nto access it and actually read it.\nAlso you can include the very basic use case in the README itself.\nNo guide for people to actually contribute\nIf you have the viewer till now and she is thinking of actually\ncontributing to your project, then kudos, your project is awesome.\nA very important part of the contributing guide is to setup the\ndevelopment environment. Again in this, it is worthwhile to get\ninto the platform specific information. For eg. Windows will have\ndifferent development environment while Ubuntu will have a different one.\nYou should mention what IDE you used or the tools that you used.\nNow your project might have some development related dependencies.\nYou should mention about that too. Now finally the viewer can have\nsuccessful environment setup to actually contribute to your code.\nNow, you might be following some conventions for writing your code,\nright? It is worth while to mention the conventions that you have\nfollowed in a separate file and link it in the README.\nThen you would have a specific way or two in which you accept others'\ncode, right? You might be using Github's Pull Request based system\nor the age old sending patches via email using git-format-patch and\ngit-send-email just like old times. Whichever you prefer, it is\nimportant to specify this in a new file possibly named as\nCONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES or something. If you have any specifics\nabout the project mention it there. Don't just expect people to know\nit by default.\nIt is also worth while to link the easy to fix bugs for new comers\nso that they can get familiar with the code base without trying to\nmingle with the core parts of the software.\nNo technical documentation\nIf you are having a big project, then you might be having a \"core\" part\nwhich is used by other parts of code. Have you documented it? Or you\njust expect people to git-grep and git-blame to find the relevant\nuse cases, definition of the functions and the documentation inside\nthe commit messages? If you are doing that, it is not exactly bad (I\nunderstand you might be having your own reasons) but it is good\nto write a technical documentation wherein you will tell the programmer\nwhat a method does and how to use it. This will also make sure she\ndoesn't write a method to do the same stuff again and thus it would\nreduce your redundancy.\nNo mention of how to run tests\nOf course you project has tests, otherwise how can you make sure\nthat by writing new code, you don't break the old code? Your README\nshould contain how to run the test suite. There are tons of different\ntest suites available in the market and it is time consuming for people\nto check out your test framework and make guesses as how one could probably\nrun it. You should mention how to run individual tests, the whole test\nsuite, and how to skip some tests, and if your test suite framework\ndoesn't support all of these features, then maybe the one you are using\nshould be replaced.\nNo license\nYes, legal matters are important too! Whether you are releasing it\nas an truly open-sourced software with BSD license or something\nelse, you should mention it. If you don't realize the importance of\nlicensing, that is maybe because your project isn't big enough.\nOnce a lot of people read your code, use it, they might try to finger\nwith it whether you like it or not. You should explicitly specify\n\"how much fingering\" you can tolerate in a separate file named\nas LICENCE in full detail like a legal document and if you are using\na popular license, you can just mention the name in the README.\nNo place to mention about bugs\nYou don't have a bug management system? Okay, I agree this isn't really\nalways required but if you do, you should explicitly mention and link\nto that. If you talk about bugs in GitHub issues, then mention it there.\nAlso if you are using GitHub, use labels to specify the bugs. If you\nstill track bugs using emails via mailing list, specify that too\nalso include a link to the old archives of the mailing list.\nNo mention about the version control system\nWell if you are seeing the project on Github, is it wrong to assume\nthat it uses git? Yes, there are many projects that I know use\nmultiple version control systems and the best example is nmap.\nThey accept patches (and PRs) in all forms and integrate it together.\nSo explicitly mention about all the version control systems that you\nwould be using and how you would accept foreign code for each.\nNo contacts\nHow should the viewer contact you in case he needs something or has\nsomething for you? Probably now you have a good incentive to give out\nyour contact information (mainly email is good) for others to contact\nyou or just say \"Thanks for the awesome software!\".\nNo fancy GUI pictures\nYou probably would have spent a hell lot of time in designing and\ntweaking the GUI and were frustrated when a font size looks bigger\nthan it should, so you should show it off. There are lots of people\nwho like the fancy GUI way of software rather than the good old\nblack terminal with green text. If you have a fancy GUI, try and\nput the pictures of it in the README. GitHub's markdown renders it, but\nI don't think man pages do. But if you really care about man pages,\nyou probably won't even have cared enough to make a fancy GUI.\nNo table of contents\nWell if you try to write everything that I have pointed out, then\nit is probably good for you to follow this advice too. Have a Table of Contents. This way, the README will look more organized and it\nwould make reading much easier.\nOkay, now that I have ranted a lot, I hope you know\nHow to Write KickAss READMEs.\n",id:"https://bauva.com/blog/writing-kickass-readmes/",title:"Writing Kickass READMEs"},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/":{body:"",id:"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/",title:"Book Summaries"},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-by-dale-carenegie/":{body:'These are the notes which I took while reading the book titled “How to win friends and influence people” written by Dale Carnegie.\nEight things this book will help people achieve:\n\nGet out of a mental rut, think new thoughts, acquire new visions, and discover new ambitions.\nMake friends quickly and easily.\nIncrease your popularity.\nWin people to your way of thinking.\nIncrease your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done.\nHandle complaints, avoid arguments, and keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant.\nBecome a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist.\nArouse enthusiasm among your associates.\n\nNine suggestions in order to get the most out of this book:\n\nDevelop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations.\nRead each chapter twice before going to the next one.\nAs you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply each suggestion.\nUnderscore each important idea.\nReview this book each month.\nApply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a working handbook to help you solve your daily life problems.\nMake a lively game out of your learning by offering some friends a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of these principles.\nCheck up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.\nKeep notes in the back of this bok showing how and when you have applied these principles.\n\nPart I: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\nPrinciple 1: Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain\n\nPeople don’t criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.\nCriticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.\nB. F. Skinner proved through his experiments that an animal rewarded for good behaviour will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behaviour.\nIf you want to change others and feel that they really need to, first be selfish and try to improve yourself. It’s also a lot less dangerous.\nAny fool can criticize, condemn and complain and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.\nCarlyle said, “A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.”\nInstead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. “To know is to forgive all.”\n\nPrinciple 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation\n\nThere is only one way to get someone to do something and that is by making the other person want to do it.\nSigmund Freud said that everything that you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.\nDr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is ‘the desire to be important’.\nWilliam James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.”\nIf our ancestors hadn’t had this flaming urge for a feeling of importance, civilization would have been impossible. Without it, we should have been just about like animals.\nThis desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest cards, and talk about your brilliant children.\nIt is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and engaging in criminal activities.\nIf you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.\nPeople sometimes become invalids in order to win sympathy and attention, and get a feeling of importance.\nIf some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle anyone can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.\n\n\nI consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people, the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.\nThere is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.\n-- Charles Schwab\n\n\nBut what do the average people do? The exact opposite. If they don’t like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing.\nOne of the reasons for the phenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie was because he praised his associates publicly as well as privately.\nA study made about runaway wives, proved that the main cause was ‘lack of appreciation’. We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.\nFlattery works seldom with discerning people. It is shallow, selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and fishworms.\nFlattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.\n\nThe difference between flattery and appreciation:\nFlatteryAppreciation\nInsincereSincere\nComes from teeth outComes from heart out\nSelfishUnselfish\nUniversally condemnedUniversally admired\n\n\nGeneral Obregon’s philosophy: “Don’t  be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.”\nOne of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation.\nEmerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.”\n\nPrinciple 3: Arouse in the other person an eager want\n\nLloyd George said that his staying on top might be attributed to his having learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish.\nWe are interested in what we want. So the only way to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.\nMany people might give to Red Cross donations because they want to lend a helping hand; they want to do a beautiful, unselfish, divine act.\nHarry Overstreet said: “Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire… and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in politics, is: First arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot talks a lonely way.”\nIf you want to persuade somebody, before you speak, pause and ask yourself” “How can I make this person want to do it?” This question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.\nHenry Ford said, “If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”\nIf salespeople can show their customers how their services or merchandise will help solve their problems, they won’t need to sell them. They’ll buy. And customers like to feel that they are buying — not being sold.\nThe world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.\nOne should have an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle.\nLooking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation.\nWilliam Winter once remarked that ‘self-expression is the dominant necessity of human nature.’ We should apply this to business dealings. When we have a brilliant idea, instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and stir the idea themselves.\n\nPart II: Six ways to make people like you\nPrinciple 4: Become genuinely interested in other people\n\nOne can make more friends by becoming genuinely interested in other people than one can in trying to get other people interested in you.\nPeople are interested in themselves — morning, noon and after dinner.\n\n\nIt is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.\n-- Alfred Adler\n\n\nMr. Thurston, a great magician, had the ability to put his personality across the footlights. He was a master showman. He knew human nature. He also had a genuine interest in people. He told that many magicians would look at the audience and say to themselves, “Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch of hicks; I’ll fool them all right.” But Thurston’s method was totally different. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to himself: “I am grateful because these people come to see me. I’m going to give them the very best I possibly can.”\nOne can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them.\nIf one wants to make friends, he should greet people with animation and enthusiasm. Say ‘Hello’ in tones that bespeak how pleased you are to have the person call.\nOld Roman poet, Publilius Syrus remarked: “We are interested in others when they are interested in us.”\nA show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way street where both parties benefit.\n\nPrinciple 5: Smile\n\nThe expression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes one wears.\nFor Schwab’s personality, his charm, his ability to make people like him, were almost wholly responsible for his extraordinary success; and one of the most delightful factors in his personality was his captivating smile.\nActions speak louder than words, and a smile says, “I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you.”\nProf James V. McConnell, said, “People who while tend to manage, tech and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. There’s far more information in a smile than a frown. That’s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.”\nThe effect of smile is powerful — even when it is unseen. When you smile while talking on phone, you ‘smile’ comes through in your voice.\nIf you don’t feel like smiling, then first force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.\n\n\nAction seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.\nThus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there…”\n-- William James (Philosopher)\n\n\nEverybody in the world is seeking happiness and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.\nShakespeare said, “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”\n\n\nWhenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp. Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move straight to the goal. Keep your mind of the great and splendid things you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will find yourself unconsciously seizing upon he opportunities that are required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular individual… Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude — the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.\n-- Elbert Hubbard\n\n\nYour smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the lives of all who see it.\nWhen someone is under pressure from his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents or children, a smile can help him realize that all is not hopeless — that there is joy in the world.\n\nThe Value of a Smile at Christmas\n\nIt costs nothing, but creates much.\nIt enriches those who receive, without impoverishing those who give.\nIt happens in a flash and the memory of it sometimes last forever.  None are so rich they can get along without it, and none so poor but are richer for it’s benefits.\nIt creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is the countersign of friends.\nIt is rest to the weary, daylight to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and Nature’s best antidote for trouble.\nYet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it is something that is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away.\nAnd if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our salespeople should be too tired to give you a smile, my we ask you to leave one of yours?\nFor nobody needs a smile so much as those who have none left to give!\n\nPrinciple 6: Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language\n\nWhenever Franklin Roosevelt met a new acquaintance, he found out this or her complete name and some facts about his or her family, business and political opinions. He fixed all these facts well in mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met that person, even if it was a year later, he was able to shake hands, inquire after the family, and ask about the hollyhocks in the backyard.\nJim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name rather than in all other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it — and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.\nSometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly if it is hard to pronounce. Rather than even try to learn it, many people ignore it or call the person by an easy nickname. That’s the exact time when one shouldn’t. The other person might not be expecting it and would be over-enjoyed by the gesture.\nWhen Carnegie wanted to do a business partnership with the other person, he suggested his name which made him more interested in the deal.\nAndrew Carnegie was proud of the fact that he could call many of his factory workers by their first names, and he boasted that while he was personally in charge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming steel mills.\nThe bigger the corporation gets, the colder it becomes. One way to warm it up is to remember people’s names. The executive who can’t remember names doesn’t realize a significant part of his business and is operating on quick sand.\nPeople are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate them at any cost.\nFor many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists, musicians and authors so that their creative works would be dedicated to them.\nMost people don’t remember names, for the simple reason that they don’t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are too busy.\nOne of the first lessons a politician learns is this: “To recall a voter’s name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion.” And the ability to remember names is almost as important in business and social contacts as it is in politics.\nNapoleon took great trouble in remembering names and often asked people multiple times and even asked them to spell it out.\nAll this takes time but ‘Good Manners’ are made up of petty sacrifices.\nWe should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing and nobody else. The name sets the individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on a special importance when we approach the situation with the name of the individual.\n\nPrinciple 7: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves\n\nListen intently and be genuinely interested. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.\nCharles W Eliot said, “There is no mystery about successful business intercourse… Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is flattering as that.”\nListening was not mere silence, but a form of activity. Listen with your mind and attentively consider what you had to say while you say it.\nListening is just as important in one’s home life as in the world of business.\nAt times, people don’t want advice. They merely want a friendly, sympathetic listener to whom he could unburden himself. That’s what we all want when we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer wants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.\nIf you never listen to anyone for long and talk incessantly about yourself, you will make people shun you and laugh at you behind your back and even despise you.\nPeople who talk only of themselves think only of themselves.\nSo if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.\nRemember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems.\n\nPrinciple 8: Talk in terms of the other person’s interests\n\nWhenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested since he knew that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures the most.\nTalking in terms of other person’s interests pays off for both parties.\nAt times the reward is an enlargement of your own life when you speak to someone about his/her interests.\n\nPrinciple 9: Make the other person feel important — and do it sincerely\n\nIf we are so contemptibly selfish that we can’t radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return — we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve.\nThe law is: Always make the other person feel important.\nHuman’s deepest desire is to be felt important.\nMost important rule: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\nEveryone wants the approval of those with whom they come in contact. Everyone wants recognition of their true worth. Nobody wants to listen to cheap, insincere flattery, but one does crave sincere appreciation.\nLittle phrases such as “I’m sorry to trouble you”, “Would you be so kind as to — ?”, “Won’t you please?”, “Would you mind?” “Thank you” — little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life — and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.\nThe unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.\n\nPart III: How to Win People to your Way of Thinking\nPrinciple 10: The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it\n\nDon’t try to prove someone wrong when your opinion is not asked\nYou can’t win an argument. You can’t because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph\n\n\nA man convinced against his will\nIs of the same opinion still.\n\n\nIf you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s good will.\n-- Ben Franklin\n\n\nWould you rather have an academic, theatrical victory or a person’s good will?\nBuddha said, “Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love’, and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.\n\n\nWelcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.\nDistrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best.\nControl your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry.\nListen First. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build bridges of understanding. Don’t build higher barriers of misunderstanding.\nLook for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree.\nBe honest. Look for areas where you can admit error and say so. Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and reduce defensiveness.\nPromise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly ahead and find yourself in position where your opponents can say: “We tried to tell you, but you wouldn’t listen.”\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you may turn your opponents into friends.\nPostpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:\nCould my opponents by right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it, will the disagreement bow over? Is this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n\n— Excerpt from Bit’s and Pieces\n\nPrinciple 11: Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, “You’re wrong”\n\nYou can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a gesture just as eloquently as you can in words — and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have struct a direct blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want to change their minds.\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it.\n\n\nMen must be taught as if you taught them not\nAnd things unknown proposed as things forgot\n— Alexander Pope\n\n\nYou cannot teach a man anything;\nYou can only help him find it within himself.\n— Galileo\n\n\nBe wiser than other people if you can;\nBut do not tell them so.\n— Lord Chesterfield\n\n\nOne thing only I know, and that\nis I know nothing\n— Socrates\n\n\nIf a person makes a statement that you think is wrong — yes, even that you know is wrong — isn’t it better to begin by saying: “Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let’s examine the facts.”\nYou will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and board-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.\nFew people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion, fear, envy and pride.\n\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear us, but our self-esteem which is threatened… The little word ‘my’ is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force whether it is ‘my’ dinner, ‘my’ dog, and ‘my’ house, or ‘my’ father, and ‘my’ God. We not only resent the imputation that our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that our conception of the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of ‘Epictetus’, of  the medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to revision. We like to continue to believe what we have been accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when dobut is cast upon any of our assumptions lead us to seek every manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our so-called reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do.\n— The Mind in the Making by James Harvey Robinson\n\n\nI have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the other person. The way in which I have worded this statement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an evaluation or judgement, rather tha an understandinf of it. When someone expresses some feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately to feel “that’s right”, or “that’s stupid”, “that’s normal”, “that’s abnormal”, “that’s unreasonable”, “that’s incorrect”, “that’s not nice”. Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely what the meaning of the statement is to the other person.\n\n\nWhen we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our esophagus.\n‘By asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and insisting continually that they were right in laying out boards not satisfactory to their response, I got him warmed up, and the strained relations between us began to thaw and melt away. An occasional carefully put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind that possibly some of these reject pieces were actually within the grade that they had bought, and that their requirements demanded a more expensive grade. I was careful, however, not to let him think I was making an issue of this point.\nMartin Luther King said: “I judge people by their own principles — not by my own.”\n\nPrinciple 12: If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically\n\nEveryone wants a feeling of importance. So when you begin to condemn yourself, the only way he could nourish his self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing mercy.\nTry to break lances with people. Admit that you are wrong and he is right and admit it quickly, openly, and with enthusiasm.\nIf we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves?\nSay about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say — and say them before that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be minimized just as the mounted policeman did with me and Rex.\nThere is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to admit one’s errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by error.\nAnd fool can try to defend his or her mistakes — and most fools do — but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one’s mistakes.\nRemember the old proverb: “By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.”\n\nPrinciple 13: Begin in a friendly way\n\nIt is an old and true maxim that ‘a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.’ So with men, if you would win a man to you cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.\n— Lincoln\n\n\nThe sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster and storming in the world.\n\nPrinciple 14: Get the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately\n\nIn talking with people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing — and keep on emphasizing — the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.\nGet the other person saying “Yes, yes” at the outset. Keep your opponent, if possible, from saying “no”.\nA “No” response, according to Prof Overstreet, is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said “No”, all your pride and personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the “No” was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it. Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started in affirmative direction.\nThe skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of “Yes” responses. This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force to send it back in the opposite direction.\nWhen a person says “No” and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a word of two letters. The entire organism — glandular, nervous, muscular — gathers itself together into a condition of rejection.\nWhen, to the contrary, a person says “Yes”, none of the withdrawal activities takes place. The organism is in a forward — moving, accepting, open attitude. Hence the more “Yeses” we can, at the very outset, induce, the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our ultimate proposal.\nSocratic method was based upon getting a ‘yes, yes’ response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously.\nThe Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of the Orient: ‘He who treads softly goes far.’\n\nPrinciple 15: Let the other person do a great deal of talking\n\nMost people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too much talking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out. They know more about their business and problems than you do. So ask them questions.\nIf you disagree with the people you are asking questions, you may be tempted to interrupt. But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.\nAlmost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early struggles. Charles T. Cubellis was no exception. He talked for a long time about how he had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He told how he had fought against discouragement and battled against ridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a day; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most important executives on Wall Street were coming to him for information and guidance.\n\nPrinciple 16: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers\n\nNo one lines to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wished, our wants, our thoughts.\nRalph Waldo Emerson in his essay ‘Self-Reliance’ stated: “In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.”\n\nPrinciple 17: Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view\n\nRemember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.\nThere is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason — and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.\nTry honestly to put yourself in his place.\nNirenberg commented: “Cooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the other person the purpose or direction of your conversation, governing what you say by what you would want to hear if you were the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the listener to have an open mind to your ideas.”\nDean Donham of the Harvard Business School said, “I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person — from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives — was likely to answer.\n\nPrinciple 18: Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires\n\nThe magic phrase to stop arguments, eliminate ill feelings, create good will, and make the other person listen attentively is: “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. if I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.”\nThree-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsty for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.\nDr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology: “Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults… show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. “Self-pity” for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some measure, practically a universal practice.”\n\nPrinciple 19: Appeal to the nobler motives\n\nAlmost all the people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.\nThe person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to chance people, appeal to the nobler motives.\nMr Thomas said, "Experience has taught me, that when no information can be secured about the customer, the only sound basis on which to proceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest, truthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges, once convinced they are correct. To put it differently and perhaps more clearly, people are honest and want to discharge their obligations.”\n\nPrinciple 20: Dramatize your ideas\n\nThis is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.\nDramatize the viewer the advantages offered by whatever is being sold — and they do get people to buy them.\n\nPrinciple 21: Throw down a challenge\n\nCharles Schwab said: “The way to get things done, is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.”\n“All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory” was the motto of the King’s Guard in ancient Greece.\nThe one major factor that motivated people was the work itself. If the work was exciting and interesting, the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a good job.\nThat is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win. That is what makes foot-races and hog-calling and pie-eating contests. The desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.\n\nPart IV: Be a Leader: How to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment\nPrinciple 22: Begin with praise and honest appreciation\n\nBeginning with praise is like the dentist who beings his work with Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is pain-killing.\n\nPrinciple 23: Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly\n\nMany people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word ‘but’ and ending with a critical statement. People feel encouraged till they hear the word ‘but’. But then they would question the sincerity of the original praise. To them, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie’s attitude toward his studies. This can be easily overcome by changing the word ‘but’ to ‘and’.\nCalling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism.\n\nPrinciple 24: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person\n\nIt isn’t nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the person criticizing beings by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from impeccable.\n\nPrinciple 25: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders\n\nGive the opportunity to people to do things themselves; let them do them and let them learn from their mistakes.\nThat technique makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A technique like that saves a person’s pride and gives him or her a feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.\nAsking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.\n\nPrinciple 26: Let the other person save face\n\nWe ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person’s pride. Whereas a few minutes’ thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person’s attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting.\nEven if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face.\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery said, “I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.”\n\nPrinciple 27: Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.”\n\nContemporary psychologist, B. F. Skinner has shown by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.\nEverybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere — not something that other person may be saying just to make one feel good.\nRemember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody wants flattery.\nThe principles taught in this book will only work when they come from the heart. The author does not advocate a bag of tricks.\nAbilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.\n\nPrinciple 28: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\n\nSamuel Vauclain said, “The average person can be led readily if you have his or her respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind of ability.”\nThere is an old saying, “Give a dog a bad name and you may as well hang him”. But give him a good name — and see what happens.\n\nPrinciple 29: Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct\n\nTell someone that he or she is stupid at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique — be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it — and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.\n\nPrinciple 30: Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest\n\nColonel House said, “Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.”\n\nEffective leader must keep the following guidelines in mind:\n\nBe sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.\nKnow exactly what it is you want the other person to do.\nBe empathetic. Ask yourself what is the other person really wants.\nConsider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.\nMatch those benefits to the other person’s wants.\nWhen you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.\n\n',id:"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-by-dale-carenegie/",title:"How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie"},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/one-up-on-wall-street-peter-lynch/":{body:"A great book which I read in Summers '18 and have started applying his\nprinciples in investing in businesses by owning stocks of public companies.\nIntroduction: The advantages of dumb money\n\nAnalysts miss ten baggers but normal people can see the companies\nselling goods around them.\nThe power of common knowledge: We can understand how consumer react to\nthe products of companies because we &amp; our friends have bought them.\nInvest only in companies which you understand. Don't invest in\nmicrocontrollers if you can't understand product specifications.\nUnderstand consumer behaviour but also read financial statements.\n\nPart I:  Preparing to Invest\n1. The Making of a Stockpicker\n\nNo such things as a hereditary knack for picking stocks.\nPlaying golf is great because it gives you access to people who have\nresources.\nStudying courses like history, psychology, political science,\nmetaphysics, epistemology, logic, religion &amp; philosophy can be\nextremely helpful if put to good use.\nMarkets aren't really efficient and anyone can beat the market with a\ndisciplined approach to investing.\n\n2. The Wall Street Oxymorons\nProblems of Wall Street Professionals:\n\nStreet Lag: Wall Street notices companies after they have had a\nsignificant boost in prices thus missing out on the majority of return.\nInspected by 4: If the fund managers buys an unknown stock and it\ndoes down, blame comes on the fund manager but if he bought IBM, blame\nshifts to the market. Also, too many people to convince to buy a\nsingle stock.\nOysters Rockeefeller: Many funds can't buy a stock not in the\nprescribed list. Also, it is easier to get returns on small funds than\nlarger ones.\nGoing it alone: Don't invest like an institution because you can then\nfocus on long term growth than quarterly results.\n\n3. Is this gambling or what?\n\nNothing went wrong with bonds\nFluctuations in long term bonds which depend on interest rates are as\nfluctuating as stock markets.\nEquities have always outperformed bonds.\nTen baggers in debts aren't possible unless one invests in distressed\ndebt.\nThere is no way to separate investing from gambling into those\ncategories that are meant to reassure us.\n\n4. Passing the Mirror Test\nAsk yourself these questions before investing in stocks:\n\nDo I have a house? A house is a good first investment which of the\npeople do. It is also difficult to loose money in this.\nDo I need the money? Only invest what you could afford to loose\nwithout that loss having any effect on your daily life in the\nforseeable future.\nDo I have the personal qualities it takes to success?\n\nPatience\nSelf Reliance\nCommon Sense\nA tolerance for pain\nOpen mindedness\nDetachment\nPersistence\nHumility\nFlexibility\nA wilingness to do independant research\nAn ability to ignore general panic\nYou need to be able to resist your human nature and your \"gut feeling\"\nWhen it comes to predicting the market, the important skill here\nisn't listening, but instead it's snoring.\n\n\n\n5. Is this a good market? Please don't ask\n\nTalking about good markets, bad market, bull/bear phases is futile.\nPenultimate Preparedness: We always keep preparing ourselves for the\nlast thing that's happened, as opposed to what's going to happen next.\nThe next time isn't like the last time.\nThe Cocktail Theory:\n\nWhen ten people would rather talk to a dentist about plaque than to\nthe manager of an equity mutual fund about stocks, it's likely that\nthe market is going to turn up.\nIn stage two, after Peter confesses what he does for a living, the\nnew acquaintances linger a bit longer - perhaps to tell Peter about\nhow risky stock market is before they talk to the dentist. The\nmarket is 15% up.\nIn stage three, with the market 30% up from stage 1, a crowd of\ninterested parties ignores the dentist and circles around Peter all\nevening.\nIn stage four, crowd starts telling Peter what to buy. This is a sign\nthat market has reached a top.\nAs Warren Buffet says, \"The stock market is only a reference to see\nif anybody is offering to do anything foolish.\"\n\n\n\nThings to remember from this section:\n\nDon't overestimate the skills and wisdom of professionals.\nTake advantage of what you already know\nLook for opportunities that haven't been discovered and certified by\nWall Street companies that are \"off the radar scope\".\nInvest in a house before you invest in a stock.\nInvest in companies, not in the stock market.\nIgnore short term fluctuations.\nLarge profits can be made in common stocks.\nLarge losses can be made in common stocks.\nPredicting the economy is futile.\nPredicting the short-term direction of the stock market is futile.\nThe long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and\nalso far superior to the long term returns from bonds.\nKeeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an\nendless stud-poker hand.\nCommon stocks aren't for everyone, nor even for all phases of a persons'\nlife.\nThe average person is exposed to interesting local companies and\nproducts years before the professionals.\nHaving an edge will help you make money in stocks.\nIn the stock market, one in hand is worth ten in the bush.\n\nPart II: Picking Winners\n6. Stalking the tenbagger\n\nTry to find stocks in products of everyday companies\nTry to find the industry where you work or know about in detail.\n\n7. I've Got it, I've Got it - What is it?\n\nTreat the company you saw at the mall as an anonymous tip and do your\nown thorough analysis\nBig companies move small while small companies move big.\n\nThe Six Categories:\n\nThe Slow Growers:\n\nLarge &amp; aging companies\nHigh dividend because no place else to invest money\n\n\nThe Stalwarts:\n\nHave economic \"moats\"\nBig companies\nBetter returns than cash\nDoesn't fall in value easily even if grossly overprices\n\n\nThe Fast Growers:\n\nSmall, aggressive high growth companies\nDoesn't necessarily have to belong to fast-growing industry\nPlenty of risk since companies are over-zealous and underfinanced\nOnce they turn to slow growers, the stock gets beaten.\nLook out for good balance sheets and making substantial profits.\nFiguring out when they'll stop growing, and how much to pay for\ngrowth is tricky and non-trivial.\n\n\nThe Cyclicals:\n\nProfits rise and fall in regular but not completely predictable\nfashion.\nAutos, airlines, tire companies, steel companies, chemical companies\nand even defense companies.\nFlourish in expanding economies (more than stalwarts) while if it\ngoes in the other direction, it is east to loose a lot.\n\n\nThe Turnarounds:\n\nBattered &amp; depressed\nNo growers\nBut they make up lost ground very quickly\n\n\nThe Asset Plays:\n\nCompanies sitting on something valuable like cash or real estate.\nIt can also be loyal subscribers who pay monthly.\n\n\n\nHighfliers to Low Riders: Companies don't stay in the same category\nforever.\nExit the position in accordance to the stock category it belongs to.\n8. The Perfect Stock, What a Deal!\n\nIt sounds dull or even better ridiculous\nIt does something dull\nIt's a spinoff\nThe institutions don't own it, and the analysts don't follow it\nThe rumors around: It's involved with toxic waste and/or the mafia\nThere is somethign depressing about it\nIt's a no-growth industry\nIt's got a niche\nPeople have to keep buying it\nIt is a user of technology\nThe insiders are buying it\nThe company is buying back its shares\n\n9. Stocks - I'd avoid\n\nIf you aren't clever at selling hot stocks (and the fact that you have\nbought them is a due that you won't be), you would soon see your profits\nturn to loss.\nHigh growth &amp; hot industries attract a very smart crowd that wants to\nget into business. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists stay awake\nnights trying to figure out how to get into the act as quickly as\npossible.\nBeware of the next something\nAvoid companies who prefer to blow money on foolish acquisitions.\nBeware the whisper stock\nBeware the middleman companies whose major sales come from a single\nentity.\nBeware the stock with the exciting name\n\n10. Earnings, Earning, Earnings\n\nPeople who work in secure jobs that pay low salaries and modest raises\nare slow growers, the human equivalent of the electric utilities.\nPeople who command good salaries and get predictable raises, such as\nmiddle-level managers of corporations are stalwarts.\nFarmers, hotel and resort employees, summer camp operator who make money\nin short bursts are cyclicals.\nThose who live off family fortunes but contribute nothing from their\nown labor are asset plays.\nGuttersnipes, drifters, down-and-outers, bankrupts, workers who've\nbeen laid off, and others in the unemployment lines are all potential\nturnarounds, as long as there's any energy left in them.\nActors, inventors, real estate develoeprs, small businessmen, athletes,\nmusicials are all potential fast growers but also extremely risky.\nP/E low for slow growers and high for fast growers.\nAvoid stocks with excessively high P/E ratios\nWhen you find that a few stocks are selling at inflated prices, it's\nlikely that most stocks are selling at inflated prices.\nInvestors pay more for stocks when interest rates are low.\nDon't try to predict earnings\nFigure out how the company plans to increase it's earnings.\nThe five basic ways are: reduce costs, raise prices, expand into new\nmarkets, sell more of its product in the old markets, or revitalize,\nclose or otherwise dispose off a losing operation.\n\n11. The Two Minute Drill\n\nGive a two minute monologue that covers the reason why you are\ninterested in a particular stock.\nThe mistake Peter did when he bought Buildner's was that he assumed\nthat he cloning this model would work everywhere which didn't turn\nout to be true.\n\n12. Getting the facts\n\nTry to get the most out of your broker especially if you are using a\nfull service brokerage firm.\nCalling the company:\n\nInvestors relations are often helpful and provide a good info only\nif you know how to ask.\nIgnore the marketing bullshit and focus on the actual business.\n\n\nVisit the headquarters\nVisit investors relations in person\n\n13. Some Famous Numbers\n\nPercent of sales\nThe P/E ratio\nThe cash position\nThe debt factor\nDividend\nBook value (extremely tricky)\nmore hidden assets like inventory, real estate subsidiaries, tax breaks,\netc.\nCashflows\nPension Plans\nEarning growth\n\n14. Rechecking the Story\n\nThree stages: start-up phase (riskiest), rapid expansion phase (most\nmoney is made), mature/saturation phase (where company struggles to\nincrease earnings).\nOne has to always be on it's toes and keep rechecking the company.\n\n15. The Final Checklist\nStocks in general:\n\nP/E ratio, its relative value in the industry\n% of institutional ownership (the lower the better)\nWhether insiders are buying &amp; the company itself buying back its own\nshares. Both +ve.\nGrowth &amp; consistency of earnings (except for asset play)\nWhether a strong balance sheet (debt to equity ratio)\nThe cash position\n\nSlow Growers:\n\nIf bought for dividends, check for consistency and growth.\n% of earnings as dividends\n\nStalwarts:\n\nBig companies which wouldn't go out of business\nBut check for P/E ratio\nPossible diworseifications that may reduce earnings\nCheck the company's long term growth rate\nCheck how the company has fared during previous recessions\n\nCyclicals:\n\nKeep a close watch on inventories and supply demand relationship.\nAnticipate a shrinking P/E multiple over time as business recovers and\ninvestors look ahead to the end of the cycle when peak earnings are\nachieved.\nIf you know the cyclical, you have an advantage in figuring out the\ncycles.\n\nFast Growers:\n\nVerify whether the fast growing business is a major part of the company's\nbusiness.\nGrowth rate in earnings\nCompany has duplicated its success in multiple locations.\nCompany still has room to grow\nWhether the expansion is speeding up or slowing down.\nFew institutions &amp; only handful of analysts cover the stock.\n\nTurnarounds:\n\nCan the company survive a raid by its creditors? How much cash the\ncompany has? How much debt? What is the debt structure?\nIf bankrupt, what's left for the shareholders?\nHow is the company supposed to be turning around? How it rid itself of\nunprofitable divisions?\nIs business coming back?\nAre costs being cut?\n\nAsset Plays:\n\nWhat's the value of the assets? Are there are any hidden assets?\nHow much debt is there to detract from these assets?\nIs the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?\nIs there a raider in the wings to help shareholder reap the benefits of\nthese assets?\n\nSome more pointers from this section?\n\nUnderstand the nature of the companies you own and the specific relations\nfor holding the stock.\nBy putting your stock into categories, you'll have a better idea of\nwhat to expect from them\nBig companies have small moves and small companies have big moves.\nConsider the size, if you expect to profit from a product.\nLook for small companies that are already profitable and have proven\nthat their concept can be replicated.\nBe suspicious of copmanies with growth rates of 50% to 100% a year.\nAvoid hot stocks in hot industries.\nDistrust diworseifications\nLong shots almost never pay off\nIt's better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a\ncompany's plans are working out.\nPeople get incredibly valuable information from their jobs that may not\nreach the professionals.\nSeparate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very\nsmart, very rich and his or her last tip went up.\nSome stock tips from experts in the field may turn out to be valuable.\nInvest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favour,\nand haven't caught the fancy of Wall Street.\nModerately fast growers (20-30%) in non-growth industries are ideal\ninvestments.\nLook for companies with niches.\nWhen purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the\nones with superior financial conditions.\nCompanies that have no debt can't go bankrupt.\nManagerial ability may be important, but it's quite difficult to assess.\nA lot of money can be made when a troubled company turns around.\nCarefully consider P/E ratio. If overprices, it's difficult to make money.\nFind a story line to follow as a way of monitoring company's progress.\nLook for companies that consistently buy back shares.\nStudy the dividend record for consistency &amp; growth.\nLook for companies with little or no institutional ownership.\nFavour companies in which management has a significant personal\ninvestment.\nInsider buying is a positive sign.\nDevote an hour a week to do investment research.\nBe patient. Watched stock never boils.\nBuying stocks purely on book value is dangerous.\n\nPart III\n16. Designing a Portfolio\n\n\nIf you have high expectations you will more likely get frustrated at\nstocks for defying you, and you may become impatient. Or worse, you\nmay take unnecessary risks in the pursuit of illusory payoffs.\n\n\nThe only way to maximize long-term gains is to stick to a strategy\nthrough good and bad years.\n\n\nHow many stocks is too many? Don't rely on any fixed number of stocks\nbut rather judge on a case by case basis.\n\n\nIf looking for a ten bagger, more stocks you own, better it is.\n\n\nSpreading your money among several categories of stocks is another\nway to minimize downside risk.\n\n\nCategorizing:\n\nSlow growers: Low risk, low gain\nStalwarts: Low risk, moderate gain\nAsset Plays: low risk, high gain\nCyclicals may be low risk &amp; high gain or high risk and low gain\ndepending on investor's ability at understanding cycles.\nFast Growers: high risk, high gain\n\n\n\nCheck company stories regularly, not prices.\n\n\nRotate in &amp; out of stocks depending on what has happened to the price\nas it relates to the story.\n\n\n17.

It could be noted that the latter colum will be\nsignificantly bigger than the former.\nThis says that the real comforts of life cost but a small portion of\nwhat most of us can earn.\nIt is the eyes of others and not our own eyes which ruin us.\nOne doesn\'t get ahead by vanity and envy.\nA handful of aristocrats run up a false standard of perfection and in\nendeavoring to rise to that standard, we run up a false standard of\nperfection, and thus we constantly\nkeep ourselves poor.\nOne cannot accumulate a fortune by taking the road that leads to poverty.\nOne who is accustomed to gratify every whim and caprice, will find it\nhard at first, to cut down their various unnecessary expenses, and will\nfeel it a great self-denial to spend less.\nSlowly adding to your pile feels amazingly rewarding than squandering\nthe new found wealth.\nProsperity is a more severe ordeal than adversity, especially sudden\nprosperity. "Easy come, easy go" is an old and true proverb.\nMany people as they begin to prosper, immediately expand their ideas\nand commence expending for luxuries, until a short time their expenses\nswallow up their income, and they become ruined in their ridiculous\nattempts to keep up appearances, and make a "sensation".\nRemember the song "Hotel California". It explains about the effects\nof luxuries.\nA person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick. He has\nno ambition; no incentive; no force.\nThe closer we keep to the laws of nature, the nearer we are to good\nhealth, and yet how many persons there are who pay no attention to\nnatural laws, but absolutely transgress them, even against their own\nnatural inclination.\nThe "sin of ignorance" is never winked at in regard to the violation\nof nature\'s laws; their infraction always brings the penalty.\nOne of the harmful habits is tobacco.\nAnother perilous feature is that this artificial appetite, like jealousy,\n"grows by what it feeds on" when you love that which is unnatural, a\nstronger appetite is created for the hurtful thing than the nature\ndesire for what is harmless.\nHabit is second nature. But an artificial habit is stronger than nature.\nBoys stick to tobacco and alcohol and persevere until at last they\nconquer their natural appetites and become the victims of acquired\ntastes.\nThe more a man smokes, the more he craves smoking; the last cigar smoked\nsimply excites the desire for another.\nA tobacco consumer\'s palate has become narcotized by the noxious weed,\nhe has lost, in a great measure, the delicate and enviable taste for\nfruits. This shows what expensive, useless and injurious habits men will\nget into.\nStop intoxicating drinks. To make money, requires a clear brain. A man\nhas got to see that two and two make four; he must lay all his plans\nwith reflection and forethought, and closely examine all the details and\nthe ins and outs of business.\nAs no man can succeed in business unless he has a brain to enable him to\nlay his plans, and reason to guide him in their execution, so no matter\nhow bountifully a man may be blessed with intelligence, if the brain is\nmuddled, and his judgement warped by intoxicating drinks, it is\nimpossible for him to carry on business successfully.\nHow many good opportunities have passed, never to return, while a man\nwas sipping a "social glass" with his friend!\nHow many foolish bargains have been made under the influence of the\n"nervine" which temporarily makes its victim think he is rich!\nHow many important chances have been put off until to-morrow, and then\nforever, because the wine cup has thrown the system into a state of\nlassitude, neutralizing the energies so essential to success, in\nbusiness.\nThe use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage, is as much an infatuation,\nas is the smoking of opium by the Chinese, and the former is quite as\ndestructive to the success of the business man as the latter. It is an\nunmitigated evil, utterly indefensible in the light of philosophy,\nreligion or good sense. It is the parent of nearly every other evil in\nour country.\n\n1. Don\'t Mistake Your Vocation\n\nThe safest plan, and the most sure of success for the young man starting\nin life, is to select the vocation which is most congenial to his\ntastes.\nIf you teach some against his wishes or natural inclination, he will\nlearn what you are teaching eventually but all through life he would\nbe working up hill and seizing every excuse for leaving his work and\nidling away his time.\nUnless a man enters upon the vocation intended for him by nature, and\nbest suited to his peculiar genius, he cannot succeed.\n\n2. Select the Right Location\n\nAfter securing the right vocation, you must be careful to select the\nproper location.\nLocation determines size and growth of the business. You also have to\ncarefully understand the dynamics of supply and demand with respect to\neach cost and each revenue center.\n\n3. Avoid Debt\n\nYoung men starting in life should avoid running into debt. There is\nscarcely anything that drags a person down like debt.\nDebt robs a man of his self-respect, and makes him almost despise\nhimself. Grunting and groaning and working for what he has eaten up or\nworn out, and now when he is called upon to pay up, he has nothing to\nshow for his money.\nYou should take debt to invest in land or expanding business.\nIf a young man will only get in debt for some land and then get married,\nthese two things will keep him straight, or nothing will.\nGetting in debt for what you eat and drink and wear is to be avoided.\nIt is a foolish habit of getting credit at "the stores" and thus\nfrequently purchasing many things which might have been dispensed with.\nIf you take debt then the creditor goes to bed at night and wakes up\nin the morning better off than when he retired to bed, because his\ninterest has increased during the night, but you grow poorer while you\nare sleeping for the interest is accumulating against you.\nMoney is a very excellent servant but a terrible master.\nWhen you have money mastering you; when interest is constantly piling up\nagainst you, it will keep you down in the worst kind of slavery. But let\nmoney work for you, and you have the most devoted servant in the world.\nThere is nothing animate or inanimate that will work so faithfully as\nmoney when placed at interest, well secured. It works night and day, and\nin wet or dry weather.\nDo not let it work against you; if you do there is no chance for success\nin life so far as money is concerned.\n\n4. Persevere\n\nWhen a man is in the right path, he must persevere. I speak of this\nbecause there are some persons who are "born tired"; naturally lazy\nand possessing no self-reliance and no perseverance.\nDavy Crockett: "This thing remember, when I am dead, Be sure you are\nright, then go ahead."\nIt is this go-aheaditiveness, this determination not to let the "horrors"\nor the "blues" take possession of you, so as to make you relax your\nenergies in the struggle for independence, which one must cultivate.\nHow many have almost reached the goal of their ambition, but, losing\nfaith in themselves, have relaxed their energies, and the golden prize\nhas been lost forever.\nAs shakespear says, "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken\nat the flood, leads on to fortune."\nSolomon: "He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand; but the\nhand of the diligent maketh rich."\nPerseverance is sometimes but another word for self-reliance.\nMany persons naturally look on the dark side of life, and borrow\ntrouble. They are born so. Then they ask for advice, and they will be\ngoverned by one wind and blown by another, and cannot rely upon\nthemselves. Until you can get so that you can rely upon yourself, you\nneed not expect to succeed. I have known men, personally, who have met\nwith pecuniary reverses, and absolutely committed suicide, because\nthey thought they could never overcome their misfortune. But I have\nknown others who have met more serious financial difficulties, and\nhave bridged them over by simple perseverance, aided by a firm belief\nthat they were doing justly, and that Providence would "overcome evil\nwith good."\nThe one without perseverance wants time to reflect; his hesitation is\nhis ruin; the enemy passes unmolested, or overwhelms him; while on the\nother hand, the general of pluck, perseverance and self-reliance, goes\ninto battle with a will, and, amid the clash of arms, the booming of\ncannon, the shrieks of the wounded, and the moans of the dying, you\nwill see this man persevering, going on, cutting and slashing his way\nthrough with unwavering determination, inspiring his soldiers to deeds\nof fortitude, valor, and triumph.\n\n5. Whatever you do, do it with all your might\n\n"Whatever is worth doing at all, is worth doing well."\nMany a man acquires a fortune by doing his business thoroughly, while\nhis neighbor remains poor for life, because he only half does it.\nAmbition, energy, industry, perseverance, are indispensible requisities\nfor success in business.\nFortune always favors the brave, and never helps a man who does not\nhelp himself.\nIdleness breeds bad habits, and clothes a man in rags.\nOne might do what all one can for himself, and then trust to Providence,\nor luck, or whatever you call it, for the rest.\n\n6. Depend Upon Your Own\n\nThe eye of the employer is often worth more than the hands of a dozen\nemployees.\nNo man has a right to expect to succeed in life unless he understands\nhis business, and nobody can understand his business thoroughly unless\nhe learns it by personal application and experience.\nThe possession of a perfect knowledge of your business is an absolute\nnecessity in order to insure success.\nRothschild: Be cautious and bold. One must exercise caution in\nlaying the plans, but be bold in carrying them out. A man who is all\ncaution, will never dare to take hold and be successful; and a man who\nis all boldness, is merely reckless, and must eventually fail.\nRothschild: Never have anything to do with an unlucky man or place.\nThis is because even though a man may appear to be honest and\nintelligent, yet if he tries this or that thing and alwayus fails, it\nis on account of some fault or infirmity that you may not be able to\ndiscover but nevertheless which must exist.\nLike causes produces like effects. If a man adopts the proper methods\nto be successful, "luck" will not prevent him. If he does not succeed,\nthere are reasons for it, although, perhaps, he may not be able to see\nthem.\n\n7. Use the Best Tools\n\nMen in engaging employees should be careful to get the best. If you\nget a good one, it is better to keep him, than keep changing. He learns\nsomething every day, and you are benefited by the experience he acquires.\nThose men who have brains and experience are therefore the most valuable\nand not to be readily parted with; it is better to keep them, at\nreasonable advances in their salaries from time to time.\n\n8. Don\'t get above your business\n\nYoung men after training, will often lie about doing nothing. They say,\n"I have learned my business, but I am not going to be hireling".\nThere is no greater mistake than when a young man believes he will\nsucceed with borrowed money.\nIt is more difficult for him to accumulate his first thousand dollars,\nthan all the succeeding millions.\nMoney is good for nothing unless you know the value of it by experience.\nHe does not know the value of it; nothing is worth anything, unless it\ncosts effort.\nWithout self-denial and economy, patience and perseverance, and\ncommencing with capital which you have not earned, you are not sure to\nsucceed in accumulating.\nThe road to learning is a royal one; the road that enables the student\nto expand his intellect and add every day to his stock of knowledge,\nuntill, in the pleasant process of intellectual growth, he is able to\nsolve the most profound problems. So for wealth. Go on in confidence,\nstudy the rules, and above all things, study human nature. One might\nfind that while expanding the intellect and muscles, your enlarged\nexperience will enable you everyday to accumulate more and more principal,\nwhich will increase itself by interest.\nYoung men loaded down with other people\'s money are almost sure to lose\nall they inherit, and they acquire all sorts of bad habits which, in the\nmajority of cases, ruin them in health, purse and character.\nAny legitimate business is a double blessing -- it helps the man engaged\nin it, and also helps others.\nNo profession, trade or calling, is overcrowded in the upper story.\nWherever you find the most honest and intelligent merchant or banker,\nor the best lawyer, the best doctor, the best clergyman, the best\nshoemaker, carpenter, or anything else, that man is most sought for,\nand has always enough to do.\nOne who excels all others in his own line, if his habits are good and\nhis integrity undoubted, cannot fail to secure abundant patronage, and\nwealth that naturally follows.\n\n9. Learn something useful\n\nEvery man should make his son or daughter learn some trade or profession,\nso that in these days of changing fortunes -- of being rich today and\npoor tomorrow -- they may have something tangible to fall back upon.\nThis provision might save many persons from misery, who by some\nunexpected turn of fortune have lost all their means.\n\n10. Let hope predominate but be not too visionary\n\nMany persons are always kept poor, because they are too visionary.\nEvery project looks to them like certain success, and therefore they\nkeep changing from one business to another, always in hot water, always\n"under the harrow". The plan of "counting the chickens before they are\nhatched" is an error of ancient date, but it does not seem to improve\nby age.\n\n11. Do Not Scatter Your Powers\n\nEngage in one kind of business only, and stick to it faithfully until you\nsucceed, or until your experience shows that you should abondan it.\nA constant hammering on one nail will generally drive it home at last, so\nthat it can be clinched. When a man\'s undivided attention is centered on\none object, his mind will constantly be suggesting improvements of value,\nwhich would escape him if his brain was occupied by a dozen different\nsubjects at once.\nMany a fortune has slipped through a man\'s fingers because he was\nengaged in too many occupations at a time. There is a good sense in the\nold caution against having too many irons in then fire at once.\n\n12. Be Systematic\n\nA person who does business by rule, having a time and place for\neverything, doing his work propmtly, will accomplish twice as much and\nwith half the trouble of him who does it carelessly and slipshod.\nBy doing one thing at a time, one can find leisure for passtime and\nrecreation.\nWhereas the man who only half does one thing, and then turns to\nsomething else, and half does that, will have his business at loose ends,\nand will never know when his day\'s work is done, for it never will be\ndone.\n\n13. Read the Newspapers\n\nAlways take a trustworthy newspaper, and thus keep thoroughly posted in\nregard to the transactions of the world.\nHe who is without a newspaper is cut off from his species.\nMany improvements in many branches of trade might not come to the notice\nof the person who doesn\'t read newspapers.\n\n14. Beware of "Outside Operations"\n\nMen with fortunes who suddenly become poor mostly because of gaming,\nand other bad habits.\nWhen he gets rich in his legitimate business, he is told of a grand\nspeculation where he can make a score of thousands. He is constantly\nflattered by his friends, who tell him that he is born lucky, that\neverything he touches turns into gold.\nHowever successful a man may be in his own business, if he turns from\nthat and engages in a business which he don\'t understand, his strength\nhas departed, and he becomes like other men.\nNever let a man foolishly jeopardize a fortune that he has earned in\na legitimate way, by investing it in things in which he has had no\nexperience.\n\n15. Don\'t Indorse Without Security\n\nOnly endore a note which you can afford to lose and care nothing\nabout, without good security.\nWhenever a man gets money for the time being without any effort or\nwithout inconvenience to himself he might be brewing trouble. Be\nskeptical in such scenario.\nDon\'t lend money to someone to spoil him into being tempted away\nfrom his legitimate business.\nA young man in business should understand the value of money. One\nmust get the first dollars by hard knocks, and at some sacrifice, in\norder to appreciate the value of those dollars.\n\n16. Advertise Your Business\n\nWe all depend upon the public for our support. Thus who deal with the\npublic must be careful that their goods are valuable; that they are\ngenuine, and will give satisfaction.\nOne must advertize with the medium which every household/person reads/\naccesses for them to tell a story about how that good or service\nsolves their problems.\nEven if a man has a genuine article, he must advertize and must have\na really good article which will easily please customers since\nanything spurious will not succeed permanently because the public is\nwiser than we expect them to be. Customer is always selfish and\nseeking the best value they can get for their money.\nIf you advertize a spurious article, and induce many people to call\nand buy it once, but they will denounce you as an imposter and\nswindler, and your business will gradually die out and leave you poor.\nFor a business to do good, you need customers to return and purchase\nagain.\nThe object in advertising is to make the public understand what you\nhave got to sell, and if you have not the pluck to keep advertising,\nuntil you have imparted that information, all the money you have\nspent is lost. The man who advertises at all must keep it up until\nthe public knows who and what he is and what is business is or else\nthe money invested in advertising is lost.\nThe advertisement\'s first job is to attract the customer to make him\nfind your product/story.\n\n17. Be Polite and Kind to your Customers\n\nPoliteness and civility are the best capital ever invested in\nbusiness.\nThe more kind and liberal a man is, the more generous will be the\npatronage bestowed upon him.\nMen who drive sharp bargains with their customers, acting as if they\nnever expect them to see them again, will never see them again as\ncustomers. People don\'t like to pay and get kicked.\n\n18. Be Charitable\n\nBeing charitable is a duty and pleasure. The liberal man will command\npatronage, while the sordid, uncharitable miser will be avoided.\nThe only true charity is that which is from the heart.\nThe best kind of charity is to help those who are willing to help\nthemselves.\nSolomon says: "There is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and\nthere is that withholdeth more meet, but it tendeth to poverty."\nPromiscuous almsgiving, without inquiring into the worthiness of the\napplicant, is bad in every sense. But to search out and quietly\nassist those who are struggling for themselves, is important.\n\n19. Don\'t Blab\n\nSome men have a foolish habit of telling their business secrets.\nIf they make money they like to tell their neighbors how it was done.\nNothing is gained by this, and oftimes much is lost. Say nothing about\nyour profits, your hopes, your expectations, your intentions.\nGoethe makes Mephistophiles say: "Never write a letter nor\ndestroy one."\nBusiness men must write letters, but they should be careful what they\nput in them.\nIf you are losing money, be specially cautious and not tell of it, or\nyou lose your reputation.\n\n20. Preserve Your Integrity\n\nYour integrity is more precious than diamonds or rubies.\nPrisons are full of dishonest people who understand very late that\nevery avenue to success is closed against him forever.\nThe public very properly shun all those integrity is doubted. They\ndo it in form of stories/gossips through variety of mediums.\nNo matter how polite and pleasant and accommodating a man may be,\nnone of us dare to deal with him if we suspect "false weights and\nmeasures."\nUncompromising integrity of character is invaluable. It secures to\nits possessor a peace and joy which cannot be attained without it --\nwhich no amount of money can purchase.\nA man who is known to be strictly honest, may be ever so poor, but\nhe has the purses of all the community at his disposal -- for all\nknow that if he promises to return what he borrows, he will never\ndisappoint them.\nDr. Franklin: "Honesty is the best policy."\nThe inordinate love of money, no doubt, may be and is "the root of all\nevil", but money itself, when properly used, is not only a "handy\nthing to have in the house," but affords the gratification of blessing\nour race by enabling its possessor to enlarge the scope of human\nhappiness and human influence.\nThe desire for wealth is nearly universal, and none can say it is\nnot laudable, provided the possessor of it accepts its\nresponsbilities, and uses it as a friend of humanity.\nThe history of money getting, which is commerce, is a history of\ncivilization, and wherever trade has flourished most, there, too,\nhave art and science produced the noblest fruits. In fact, as a\ngeneral thing, money-gettings are the benefactors of our race. To\nthem, in great measure, are we indebted for our institutations of\nlearning and of art, our academies, colleges and churches.\nIt is no\nargument against the desire for, or the possession of, wealth, to say\nthat there are sometimes misers who hoard money only for the sake\nof hoarding and who have no higher aspiration than to grasp\neverything which comes within their reach. As we have sometimes\nhypocrities in religion, and demagogues in politics, so there are\noccassionally misers among money-getters.\nGuys &amp; Girls, make money honestly, and not otherwise, for Shakespeare\nhas truly said, "He that wants money, means, and content, is without\nthree good friends."\n\nDo we wait for the starting gun?\n',id:"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/the-art-of-money-getting/",title:"The Art of Money Getting by P.

Yet, over the long run, they outperform those who take the path of higher risk.\nThe returns depend on:\n\n\nknowledge\n\n\nexperience\n\n\ntemperament\n\n\nThe investor needs to understand the business world and how it works. Some grasp of accounting, finance and corporate strategy is essential.\n\n\nTemperament is more important than IQ when it comes to being a good investor.\n\n\nGraham told Buffett that he must understand the focus employed by other people in the markets if he wanted to outperform them.\n\n\nLearning points\n\nFollow sound investment principles\nIt is only necessary to outperform the market by a few percentage points to end up with vast amounts more wealth.\nIt’s only investing if you have made a thorough analysis of the company, there is a built-in margin of safety and the objective is set as merely a satisfactory return.\nDo not accept Mr Market’s valuation of a share; do your own research.\n\nInvestment 1: Cities Services\n\nThe sense of responsibility to those who trust him is very important in understanding the way Buffett went on to treat his partners in the 1950s and 1960s, and then shareholders in Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nDo not unthinkingly grab at a small profit.\nDo not fixate on what you paid for a share.\nWhen investing other people’s money, ill feeling can be created if a mistake is made.\n\nInvestment 2: GEICO\n\nBuffett gained attention of Financial VP by explaining that he was a student of Graham’s, and he quickly demonstrated in conversation that he had read up about the firm, and asked pertinent questions, which made him gain valuable conversation with him.\nCompetitive advantages which GEICO offered:\n\nA very low cost distribution model\nA good niche market.\n\n\nGEICO also had good growth prospects and profit margins were 5 times of an average insurer. It also had a lot of free cash.\nBuffett learned from Graham, who said you are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. Look at the facts, not the crowd.\nA painful lesson for him was in inadvisability of selling a stake in an identifiably wonderful company.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nDo your homework\nIt is possible for you to see much more than the so-called experts if you are prepared to make some effort.\nLook for businesses that make profitable use of capital.\n\nInvestment 3 &amp; 4: Cleveland worsted mills and a gas station\n\nBorrowing is for very able investors and those than afford to lose the entire portfolio without affecting their lifestyle.\nAs value investors we can build in a margin of safety by refusing to value on the basis of the best possible outcome.\n\nCheck the qualitative factors\n\nProspects for the business: The investor must scan beyond the data for signs of vulnerability to disruption to business as usual.\nQuality of management:\n\nCompetence\nShareholder orientation\n\n\nStability: Industries that are not subject to much change are likely to be stable\n\nWhy companies with large surpluses  can be bad businesses:\n\nManagers have pursued value-destroying activities that have whittled away shareholder’s assets through losses year after year.\nThe stock market has irrationally pushed the price of the shares down to unreasonable levels.\nShareholders have not pressed the company to do the right thing by shareholders.

Also, it had a lot of debt and was in an industry with very poor economics.\nThe reasons for return in such investments: first, the economics might improve, second, the management might improve or be replaced, third, the business might be liquidated, fourth, a takeover bid might be accepted.\nMeeting Charlie Munger: He was one of the few people who could keep up with Buffett and give as good as he got in well-considered discussion.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nBusiness logic is one thing, being disliked is another, often overwhelming, thing. Buffett’s preference for sound franchise businesses with managers he likes, trusts and admires, who can grow a business over decades, and even his proclivity to hold shares through ups and downs. He likes building long-term positive relationship.\nGood managers can work wonders\nPatience will be rewarded\nThe importance of spotting companies using too much shareholder’s money\nThe buying price is crucial\nLook for pricing power: The ability to spot the potential for raising prices because of some degree of customer captivity was evident time and again in Buffett’s career.\n\nInvestment 8: American Express\n\nBuffett found that in some instances, companies with not so strong balance sheets but have strong economic franchises combined with sound finances and able, honest managers (if identified correctly) return significantly larger sums.\nBuffett, after the  AmEx issue, investigated seriously about the on-going business prospects from his friends and all people he could think of to conclude that the economic franchise was intact. It was a company with pricing power because it dominated its industry and had customer captivity through its strong brand and network.\nHe did’t want AmEx to shirk its responsibility for its part in the fraud because he knew that a company of this kind lives and dies by its reputation (a central component of its business franchise). It was better to take the financial hit now to preserve that reputation.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nThink about the business: There are times when short-term problems bring down a share price. In many situations the long-term value is unaffected. If the market concentrates only on the short term then the opportunity arises to buy excellent businesses with strong franchises and good managers on the cheap.\nWhen the odds are good, invest a lot\nAsk around for qualitative data: Ask the customers about how they think of the business and keep re-evaluating it at each turns.\n\nInvestment 9: Disney\nBuffett’s actions\nA key part of Buffett’s research was to go and sit in the cinema surrounded by a whole bunch of children watching Marry Poppins. he could see how much they loved the Disney product for himself. And he could see that with the valuable feedback catalogue, people would keep paying for Disney films, generation after generation. The wonderful thing about Snow White, for example, is that once it has been made and you have written off the cost, you can bring it out again and again. Furthermore, you can use the love of the characters in many different forms, from licensing on children’s school bags and t-shirts to theme parks. And Mickey Mouse does not have an agent (unlike Tom Cruise, say) who might take much of the value generated by a film franchise for their client.\nBuffett and Munger met Walt Disney and admired his devotion to his work and his infectious enthusiasm.\nBuffett logic - more like Fisher and Munger than Graham\nBuffett was putting a great deal of weight on the intangible assets of Disney and paying little attention to the balance sheet assets.\nLearning Points:\n\nMr Market can be a Dumbo\nBusinesses needing little additional capital to generate increased profits can be a goldmine\nScuttlebutt again\nObserve quality in everyday life\nDon’t sell too soon: Have a idea/investment thesis for a decision and don’t back out just because it has become over-valued/under-valued, until your idea is achieved.\n\nInvestment 10: Berkshire Hathaway\n\nLacked competitive advantage because it was unable to prevent new entrants to their market.\nIt was a commodity business\nIt was a business of bad economics of industry\nLesson from the fateful buy back: Don’t be intimidated by someone’s behaviour and sell when the idea/investment thesis ends for you.\nA struggling business needed to be run by the right person for it to succeed.\nBuffett’s role in the companies he controls is three-fold:\n\nCapital allocation\nSelecting the key person(s) and thinking through the right incentive package\nCheering on the managers who are performing well. He does not need regular meetings or briefings, but he does like to read the numbers coming from the operating units\n\n\n\nThe way Buffett organized this business:\n\nGet rid of the liquidator reputation: After being hurt greatly by the loathing people of Beatrice, he announced that there would be no mill closings.\nAllocation of tasks: Buffett was true to his word: anything to do with the mill operations was up to Ken Chace. Buffett’s job was to look after the money.\nIncentives: Buffett does not like executive options because they offer rewards without the downside risk, and they encourage mangers to gamble with shareholder’s money.\nFocus on return on capital employed: He wasn’t focused on the level of output of the mills, or the volume of sales or market share, or just profit. He thought what really matters is the percentage return on capital employed.\nRelease Cash: Existing cash was not being used to generate adequate returns in BH.\nSend bad news early: Chace was asked to warn Buffett if unpleasant surprises might be around the corner.\nPraise key people: People respond to signals that they are appreciated; it’s only fair that they are told they are doing a good job if that is the case.\nBuffett would be the only one who could allocate capital\n\nChace managed to do as he had been asked and released capital tied up in inventories and non-current assets. Dividends were at first meager and then non-existent, thus saving cash.\nLearning Points:\n\nDon’t get emotional\nManagement of high ability and integrity are crucial: A business with good economics is better than a business with bad economics but extremely talented managers.\nReallocate capital\nTry to behave decently with all who come into contact with: His reputation for decency, while born of his inherently generous nature, rather than being affected, is an important business asset. Many families who wanted to sell their businesses have found a welcoming home within the Berkshire family, where continuity, long-term value and integrity have always been important watchwords, and where asset-stripping and other forms of short-termism were anathema. People like working with their friend Warren Buffett, who offers them freedom to manage, respect, praise and a sense of purpose.\n\nInvestment 11: National Indemnity Insurance\n\nJack Ringwalt believed: “There’s no such thing as a bad risk. There are only bad rates.”\nJack knew when to take a risk and when to back away — the odds had to be right.\nBuffett felt a need to widen his circle of competence to encompass the insurance business. Thus he spent a long time in libraries researching the mechanisms and logic of insurance.\nBuffett asked Ringwalt to send him the same information he was sending out to the small number of outside shareholders. Ringwalt mistakenly thought that Buffett was flattering him by showing an interest in how NICO managed its investment float. he thought Buffett might want to learn from him about what shares to invest in and he agreed to send Buffett the information. Of course, what Buffett was really interested in was the operations of the business and he gained an impression of many years of the business’ history from the material Ringwalt sent him.\nBuffett has a wonderful knack for holding on to very talented and experienced people. He doesn’t mind that they are getting on in years; their knowledge, judgement and contacts are often vital to the success of the enterprise. Besides, he has numerous investments to think about; he simply cannot deal with the day-to-day detail of running any one company.\nNICO was a specialist in commercial auto and general liability insurance and did not appear to have any attributes that would overcome the industry’s chronic troubles. It has no informational advantage (the company has never had an actuary), was not a low-cost operator, and sold through general agents. The only thing it had right was a managerial mindset that most insurers find impossible to replicate.\nIt was that company who could take a decline in revenue due to lack of profitability and higher risks.\nMany insurers lose money because they chase after business, driving down the premiums they charge. managers of these companies are often reluctant to forgo volume and market share. They want to keep the staffing levels high so they drive volume of business up. This makes insurance profits cyclical, because when insurers lose money from badly priced policies many go bust or are forced to cut back, leading eventually to raised premiums and the start of another cycle.\nThe combination of a growing pot of no-cost float and Buffett’s investing prowess applied to that float is a very important factor in his success.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nThe investor should be prepared to observe a good company for years before buying: Do the analysis and put it on your watch list. Have a valuation in mind. If the opportunity arises then you can invest with discipline intact. If the opportunity never arises then use your money elsewhere, where you can invest with a margin of safety.\nThe float held by insurance companies can be invested to make a fortune.\nHold on to good thing for decades\n\nInvestment 12: Hochschild - Kohn\n\nCase of a “second-class department store at a third-class price”.\nBuffett on this: “Even if the price had been cheaper but the management had been run-of-the-mill, we would not have bought the business.”\nBuffett — “It also does not seem sensible to me to trade known pleasant personal relationships with high grade people, at a decent rate of return, for possible irritation, aggravation or worse at potentially higher returns.”\nThe problem with retail businesses is that the managers are usually under constant attack from competitors. As Buffett puts it, retail managers have to be “smart every day”, whereas in other industries the managers do not destroy the business even if they perform in a mediocre fashion for a period.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nIt’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\nGood jockeys will do well on good horses, but not on broker down nags: Buffett said that when a management with a reputation for brilliance tackled a business with a reputation for bad economics, it would be the reputation of the business that remained intact.\nAvoid businesses with problems: It’s more profitable to simply stick with the easy and obvious than it is to resolve the difficult.\nThe overwhelming importance in business of the unseen force, the institutional imperative:\n\nAs if governed by Newton’s First Law of Motion, an institution will resist any change in its current direction;\nJust as work expands to fill available time, corporate projects or acquisitions will materialize to soak up available funds;\nAny business craving of the leader, however foolish, will be quickly supported by detailed rate-of-return and strategic studies prepared by his troops\nThe behavior of peer companies, whether they are expanding, acquiring, setting executive compensation or whatever, will be mindlessly imitated.\n\n\nBuffett was born neither an investor nor a businessman: The learning process took decades to get to a reasonably high standard and still mistakes were made. An interest in lifelong learning is a prerequisite for an investor. Buffett’s openness to correction has meant that he has made a sufficient number of good calls to produce a superior performance overall.\n\nInvestment 13: Associated Cotton Shops\n\nBuffett greatly admired a penny-pincher and a workaholic\nRosner was highly paranoid of his business\nWhen Rosner offered to show Buffett around a few stores so he could see what he might be buying, Buffett turned him down flat. The details of retailing were beyond his circle of competence. What was within his circle was the financial situation of the company then and in the recent past. So he asked Rosner to read the previous five years of balance sheet data over the phone.\nBuffett likes to move quickly to get the other person what he wants. But he doesn’t sacrifice his quality at all. He has looked up other businesses almost everywhere he can find and understood the economics of that business and other competitors.\nRosner later told his friend Buffett why it worked: \"You forgot you bought this business. And I forgot I sold it.” This displays the Buffett’s hands-off managerial style.\nBut he was very keen on receiving monthly reports on how the business was operating. While he felt he had no eye for retail, Buffett had a very sharp eye for financials.\nThe retail industry is a very difficult game to get right, but some people have a special talent for wringing out high rates of return on capital employed.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nCircle Competence: We all have a circle of competence, but some people think their circle is much bigger than it really is. Buffett (and Munger) each define their circles quite narrowly. In other words they freely acknowledge that there are many subjects for which they have insufficient competence to be able to draw conclusions from data presented to them. They regard most industries as lying outside of their circle of competence — they simply cannot analyse investments in those fields.\nIt’s great to partner with keen cost-cutters: Rosner knew his business inside out and he was in the habit of looking for every ways to remove every ounce of fat from its operations every day.\nPeople value respect as much as financial reward: Rosner liked the mutual respect and trust between Buffett and himself. This manifest in the freedom he was given to control his domain, the praise that was lavished upon him and the absolute trust Buffett placed in him not to behave in a way harmful to the interests of Buffett’s partners.\n\nInvestment 14: Investing in Relationships\n\nEach crash teaches revelatory lessons to those who pay little attention to stock market history. To wiser heads it reinforces the determination to remember to take a position to exploit the madness of the crowd, rather than to participate in the madness.\nA booming market is an opportunity for asset managers to earn substantially more in fees, as everyone wants to be in shares.\nBuffett had an innate sense of decency and honour, and would honestly try to do his best for his partners, many of whom were close friends or relatives.\nBuffett pondered whether he should join the crowd and go for short-term plays and the exciting companies of tomorrow, even if they lacked a profit history? Into this mix, a major factor was that he was already rich and maybe he should try to concentrate on other things like family.\n“The course of the stock market will determine, to a great degree, when we will be right, but the accuracy of our analysis of the company will largely determine whether we will be right.” — Buffett. In other words, we tend to concentrate on what should happen, not when it would happen.\nBuffett thought that two ingredients were now missing. He was no longer a “hungry twenty-five-year-old working with $105,100 initial partnership capital”. He was now a “better fed” 36-year-old who had the difficulty of investing a much larger amount of money: $54m. He had to buy in larger amounts to move the dial of performance and this cut down the number of possible companies because not many had a sufficiently large free float (shares held by investors other than those closely connected with the firm, e.g. founding family or directors). Second, the market environment was no longer conducive to successful implementation of his investment philosophy. At the beginning of the partnership, in a market environment of much lower share prices relative to assets and earnings, there were substantial numbers of companies selling significantly below the value to a private owner: 15 to 25 companies could be identified and Buffett could be “enthusiastic” about the probabilities inherent in all holdings.”\nBuffett never intended to step outside his circle of competence. If an investment technique who soundness he can neither affirm nor deny doesn’t satisfy his intellect (or perhaps his prejudices), and neither does it fit his temperament.\nHe won’t seek out activity in investment operations, even if offering splendid profit expectations, where major human problems appear to have a substantial chance of developing.\n\n\nThe evaluation of securities and businesses for investment purposes has always involved a mixture of qualitative and quantitative factors… Interestingly enough, although I consider myself to be primarily in the quantitative school, the really sensational ideas I have had over the years have been heavily weighted toward the qualitative side where I have had a ‘high-probability insight’. This is what causes the ranger register to really sing. However, it is an infrequent occurrence, as insights usually are, and of course, no insight is required on the quantitative side — the figures should hit you over the head with a baseball bat. So the really big money tends to be made by investors who are right on qualitative decisions but, at least in my opinion, the more sure money tends to be made on the obvious quantitative decisions.\n-- Buffett.\n\n\nBargains were going away. Three possible reasons:\n\nCompeting investors had jumped the badwagon\nTakeover bids had become more commonplace\nThe large increase in the number of security analyst who scouted the companies\n\n\n“When the game is no longer being played your way, it is only human to say the new approach is all wrong, bound to lead to trouble, etc. I have been scornful of such behaviour by others in the past. I have also seen the penalties incurred by those who evaluate conditions as they were — not as they are. Essentially, I am out of step”. — Buffett\nHe wanted to cut down his workload by focusing on businesses that he controlled, operated by people he liked, trusted and admired, even if this meant lower rates of return.\nWhen a stock soars, a gain is nice to have, if you know anything about stock market history you know that picking one-off winners is not a sound basis on which to project forward your future returns. What matters is the availability of numerous investment opportunities.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nMarkets go through periods of irrationality\nStick with sound investing principles in good times and bad\nLife is not all, or even principally, about making money\nMost fund managers trying to pick shares to outperform the market will not do so if you take into account the high fees they are charging.\n\nInvestment 15: Illinois National Bank and Trust\n\nIt has satisfactory return on capital employed, high returns on both assets/liabilities — earning 2% of $100m deposits and $2m over $17m of shareholder capital. It was conservatively run and achieved its returns even though it took very little risk with capital structure, liquidity and lending policy.\nIn banking it is easy to make numbers look good for a while by borrowing excessively from financial markets to lend to high-risk prospects. Everything seems fine — until the luck runs out.\nRockford bank borrowed little from capital or money markets and always maintained a high level of liquidity.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nInvest in outstanding businesses at reasonable prices\nEven better, if you can get such a business at a low price then you will do very well\nBuy high proportions of great companies\nIt is a very good sign when a company founder cares greatly about who’s buying the business\nBanks that stick to simple low-cost vanilla banking with an emphasis on low-risk and steady growth are a completely different prospect to complex banks\nA manager continually looking to gain efficiencies and cost savings is one that is likely to be worth backing\n\nInvestment 16: Omaha Sun Newspapers\n\nIt was not satisfying for Buffett to make money by watching his shares rise on the market. Satisfaction came from demonstrating that his analytical reasoning was sound.\nLogical analysis first, followed by business success, followed by share price rises. This is what made sense; the correct order of the investing universe.\nBuffett kept a newspaper clipping of the crash in 1929 on his office wall as reminder of what comes from mania.\nBuffett’s most important rules of investing:\n\nRule 1: Don’t lose money\nRule 2: Don’t forget rule 1\n\n\nHe relied on newspaper information to help develop his ideas.\nTime is precious — what you choose to read can help to form character, as well as increase breadth and depth of knowledge\n\nLearning Points:\n\nThere is more to life than short-term financial gain\nPayment of education\nHold on to good people\nDon’t forget the qualitative\n\nInvestment 17: More Insurance\nLearning Points:\n\nGrand principles are more important than a grand plan\nIntrinsic value is the focus of attention\nCapital allocation was at the heart of Buffett’s good investment performance\n\nInvestment 18: Buffett’s Investment in sanity\n\nInvestment is about understanding the business, for which you need to conduct thorough analysis.\nShort-term, or even medium-term, movements of shares on a stock market are usually unrelated and irrelevant to what is happening at the coalface of your business. In the long run the market will recognise intrinsic value, but for many months (or years) in between you can be sure that the market will do some very odd things.\n‘We don’t believe in miracles, we rely on them.’ — Buffett. It is possible for an old, overweight ball player, whose legs and batting eye are gone, to tag a fast ball on the nose for a pinch-hit home run, but you don’t change your line-up because of it.\nBuffett could not bear to let people down and he liked to be the best at what he did.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nMarket moods can be incomprehensible to value investors\nHigh cash balances are a suitable policy within an investment portfolio when few investments are available with a good margin of safety\nBehave with integrity and diligence toward those who partner in business\nShort-term performance statistics are meaningless in judging investment ability\nSmall investors have an advantage\n\nInvestment 19: Blue Chip Stamps\n\nIt collected cash upfront and had to pay back later thus having cash which could be deployed at a higher rate of return\n\nLearning Points:\n\nFloat is a very useful way to leverage a skilled investor’s resources to gain additional returns, supplying interest-free funds\nA buying opportunity may arise when there are many reluctant holders of shares\nA failing operating business does not necessarily make for a bad investment\nWorking with like-minded investors can allow greater influence and therefore a better outcome for all shareholders\n\nInvestment 20: See’s Candies\n\nBuffett started to take a keen interest in some of the key aspects of the business, particularly things to do with finance. Huggins was not required to regularly meet Buffett or anyone else from Blue Chip or Berkshire. However, data were something that Buffett looked forward to receiving, so he got sales and other statistics frequently. But note, his need for data was not so that he could direct Huggins in how to sell more candy or improve the business; he just took an interest in the performance, particularly return on capital employed.\nBuffett did not regularly phone Huggins or look over his shoulder, though he was available to consult should Huggins need to talk something over. He could call Buffett whenever he liked and Buffett would answer, or, if he was unable to do so, would call him back within an hour.\nSee’s never diverged form its chosen path of building a business franchise around quality candy.\nBuffett and Huggins agreed on the need to keep building the franchise, deepening and widening the business’ moat, by never compromising on the quality of the product, using only the best ingredients, with no preservatives, and never compromising on customer service, even if that meant a short-term profit.\nThe See’s business was a great educator; it rammed home the importance of the affection with which a branch can be held in people’s minds.\nThey devoted limited amounts of capital to test the See’s model elsewhere.\nBuffett felt that it was important that a person with a wider perspective and greater financial interest should have input on the pricing process. He felt that a manager may be averse to raising prices.\nSee’s benefited from local economies of scale particularly in advertising and distribution.\nSee’s exceptional profit occur, mainly because both new and old customers prefer the taste and texture of See’s candy, as well as the extremely high level of retailing service which characterizes its distribution. This customer enthusiasm is caused by See’s virtually fanatic insistence on expensive natural candy ingredients plus expensive manufacturing and distributing methods that ensure rigorous quality control and cheerful retail service. These qualities are rewarded by extraordinary sales per square foot in the stores, frequently two to three times those of competitors, and by a strong preference by gift recipients for See’s chocolates\nWhen it comes to reflecting the underlying reality of a business’s position, accounting numbers often provide more confusion than enlightenment. It is important that we focus on the economic reality rather than statistics emanating from accounting rules.\nAccounting rules usually dictate that a purchased business is examined to calculate the fair value of its assets after deduction of all its liabilities. In most cases this sum is much less than what was paid to acquire the business. That gives the accountant a problem: cash (or shares) was paid out of the holding company’s balance sheet, but the fair value of net assets received in return is less. It would seem that value has just disappeared. Of course, it has not disappeared; there might be very good reasons for paying a price much higher than the balance sheet fair value, say because the company has an excellent brand, lucrative patents or great relationships with customers. Thus we say that the extra amount paid above fair value is payment for goodwill.\nRules for managers and investors to follow when considering goodwill, from the accounting perspective and from the economic value perspective:\n\nWhen looking at profits from a business unit ignore goodwill write offs and amortisation charges (annual deductions to allow for declining value of intangible fixed assets such as patents or depletion of a natural resource), so that the focus is on the return earned on the unleveraged net tangible assets. \nWhen trying to make a decision on the acquisition of a business ignore amortisation charges. They should not be deducted from earnings. This means that goodwill is viewed as continuing at its full cost.\nThe cost of a business acquisition should be viewed as the entire intrinsic business value of all the payments made, whether they be in the form of cash or shares in the acquirer, not just the recorded accounting value.\n\n\n\nLearning Points:\n\nBe in a position to buy inputs in a competitive market with many suppliers, but sell where you have pricing power\nAlways praise your key managers\nEvaluate what is in the minds of customers\nLook for high returns on small amounts of capital\nPay-up for franchises\nKeep learning\n\nInvestment 21: Washington Post\n\nBuffett has busied himself analysing companies, despite not being able to take many buy decisions in late 1960s and early 1970s. As shares fell in 1973 &amp; 1974, portions of excellent business could be bought at bargain prices. Buffett was ready; he had done the preparation in the lean years and knew the quality of what he was now buying. He could pick up many shares at single digit price-to-earnings ratios.\n“Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful”\nIn stock market, there’s no penalty except opportunity lost. All day you wait for the pitch you like; then when the fields are asleep, you step up and hit it.\nBrilliant journalism and fearless editorial leadership propelled the Washington Post. The paper had worldwide renown for integrity and excellence.\nOver three-quarters of revenue came from advertising. Businesses are willing to pay a lot more to place their ad in the dominant paper. Thus, over the years, the dominant paper can reap greatly increased income without spending much more on editorial or management.\nKatherine Graham was terrified that a raider would take the company out of family hands or influence it for political purposes and so she did not receive this letter from Omaha with much affection. Buffett won over Katherine with his intelligence, decency and humour. If he trusted the key people, he was no longer worried about control. Buffett was more than willing to allow her to draw from his well of experience and rationality. He also boosted her confidence by telling her how smart she was, which he truly believed. Once again, we see Buffett clearly identifying the key person for one of his businesses and then nurturing that individual as a friend and leader. He did not second-guess Graham’s operational decisions, but supported them with advice when requested, praised work well done and offered a listening ear when difficult decisions had to be made. Buffett had no real power as a shareholder, but he did have influence because Graham trusted him as a confidant and shrewd businessman.\nShare buy-backs: Buffett pressed for share repurchases. That way, EPS should rise lifting the value of each remaining share: the discounted future annual owner earnings. This can be done when shares are selling below intrinsic value, conservatively calculated.\nThis is a best type of firms to own (but only if you buy at the right price), because they dominate their industries or segments of their industries. More importantly, they can reasonably he expected to dominate in decades from now because of their extraordinary competitive strengths.\nBuffett observed how foolish Mr Market can be, the importance of strong media industry franchises and his willingness to hold much-loved companies even if future returns were destined to be less than they gave in the past.\n\nLearning Points\n\nLook through temporary problems to the quality of the franchise when estimating intrinsic value.\nDo not be disheartened if the share falls after purchase.\nKeep holding if high returns on capital employed are likely.\nShare buy-backs are good for shareholders if the price is low enough\nDo not pay high prices in bidding wars for hot businesses\nInevitables are the best type  of firms to own (when bought at the right price)\nHigh-quality economic franchises can disappear\nDo not churn your portfolio: High rates of change in portfolio constituents will please your broker and the taxman, but damage your wealth\n\nInvestment 22: Wesco Financial\n\nWesco was kind of like mini-Berkshire due to its mix of wholly-owned operating businesses, especially insurance, and it’s collection of tradable securities, many of which were common to both Berkshire’s and Wesco’s portfolios.\nIt did well in the building boom following the second world war while after 1972, it was regarded as well managed, with high vigilance over costs and decent profits, it was viewed as sleepy and not bound for fast growth.\nWhen Buffett and Munger stopped the merger plans, the stock price felt from $17 to $11 and they needed to get more votes to get their word said, so they made an open tender offer of $17 dollars which was an extraordinary thing to do in the light of a general stock market decline. They were generous of the price so that it would not seem that they caused the merger to fail simply so that they could pick up shares at falling prices in the aftermath. Apart from the common decency and the honour code by which these two operated, Buffett and Munger needed to gain the respect, trust and dedication of Louis Vincenti, who they had already identified as they key person at Wesco.\nVincenti could see that the shareholders he had served for many years, many of whom were friends, were treated fairly. Buffett and Munger saw Vincenti as straight-talking, shrewd, independent and honourable, though cranky, and wanted him to be their long-term partner. There is that concept again — partnership — incorporating traits such as trust, respect, integrity and mutual enrichment.\nSteel suppliers operate in highly competitive markets, subject more than most to the ups and downs of the economy. For the next few years profits at Precision Steel fell. The recession-induced decline was exacerbated by what Munger and Koeppel described in their 1982 Blue Chip letter as “a business mistake. They said they should never have entered the small measuring-tool distribution business.\n(My own) Mutual funds use metal and mining companies to take bets on commodities because such companies don’t have “pricing power” and thus their profits are highly susceptible to high fluctuations in economic conditions. Thus the best time to enter such trades is in the up-tick of a business cycle and exit at the down-tick of a business cycle.\nIn 1980s (in a very high interest rate environment) a very serious problem had arised because S&amp;Ls generally offered borrowers fixed-rate mortgages stretching over decades. This money came from depositors offered floating rates. Furthermore, depositors were allowed to withdraw their money at short notice.\nTo prepare for this storm, they made a smart move which helped them by:\n\nreducing exposure to the S&amp;L market by almost two-thirds at a time when a storm was about to break,\nraising money by selling physical branch offices,\nlowering the ongoing costs of serving customers holding the remaining $150M or so of mortgages and about $170M in deposits, because branch network had gone,\nkept safe a pot of money (about $140M) held in cash, securities and deposits earning interest for Wesco. That was yet another substantial fund for Buffett and Munger to allocate on top of those in Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries and Blue Chip Stamp’s accounts.\n\n\nWesco was able to take catastrophe-related insurance, called super-cat (earthquakes, hurricanes, etc). This business required a large net worth relative to annual premiums received, because it had to withstand some enormous claims. Buyers would often wish to deal with the highest possible credit ratings and a reliable corporate personality) instead of other reinsurers less cautious, straightforward and well endowed.\nThe already strong market position (in a niche market) of KBS was enhanced by BH association. Don Towle said that being part of Berkshire meant that no one questioned KBS’ ability to pay out on claims.He also said that Buffett was very good at simply letting the company grow without interference.\n\nLearning Points:\n\nTreat your reputation as a highly important asset\nMistakes in capital allocation will be made, such as with Precision Steel\nWatch for downside risk\nTrust brings large savings\n\n",id:"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/the-deals-of-warren-buffett/",title:"The Deals of Warren Buffett By Glen Arnold"},"https://bauva.com/contact/":{body:"The best way to contact me is via email (pranit [at] bauva [dot] com).\nIf you would like to meet me in person, feel free to drop a email or\njust text me on facebook and we can meet for beer!\nYou can also find me on social media:\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nGitHub\nMedium\nLinkedIN\nGitLab\n\n",id:"https://bauva.com/contact/",title:"Pranit Bauva"}},docInfo:{"https://bauva.com/":{body:203,title:4},"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/":{body:0,title:2},"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/annual-report-fy20-21/":{body:1541,title:7},"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/annual-report-fy21-22/":{body:518,title:6},"https://bauva.com/annual-reports/annual-report-fy22-23/":{body:1762,title:8},"https://bauva.com/blog/":{body:0,title:2},"https://bauva.com/blog/cryptocurrencies-arent-a-solution/":{body:1027,title:5},"https://bauva.com/blog/deploying-with-heroku/":{body:1473,title:2},"https://bauva.com/blog/hft-firms-profits-commissions/":{body:629,title:4},"https://bauva.com/blog/intro-to-crypto-and-cryptocurrencies/":{body:2997,title:3},"https://bauva.com/blog/introduction-to-virtual-reality/":{body:691,title:3},"https://bauva.com/blog/single-view-stereo/":{body:1376,title:3},"https://bauva.com/blog/writing-kickass-readmes/":{body:778,title:3},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/":{body:0,title:2},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-by-dale-carenegie/":{body:3706,title:6},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/one-up-on-wall-street-peter-lynch/":{body:1804,title:6},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/the-art-of-money-getting/":{body:2018,title:6},"https://bauva.com/book-summaries/the-deals-of-warren-buffett/":{body:3789,title:5},"https://bauva.com/contact/":{body:28,title:2}},length:19},lang:"English"};
