Don't invest in microcontrollers if you can't understand product specifications.</li><li>Understand consumer behaviour but also read financial statements.</li></ul><h1 id=part-i-preparing-to-invest>Part I: Preparing to Invest</h1><h2 id=1-the-making-of-a-stockpicker>1. The Making of a Stockpicker</h2><ul><li>No such things as a hereditary knack for picking stocks.</li><li>Playing golf is great because it gives you access to people who have resources.</li><li>Studying courses like history, psychology, political science, metaphysics, epistemology, logic, religion &amp; philosophy can be extremely helpful if put to good use.</li><li>Markets aren't really efficient and anyone can beat the market with a disciplined approach to investing.</li></ul><h2 id=2-the-wall-street-oxymorons>2. The Wall Street Oxymorons</h2><p>Problems of Wall Street Professionals:</p><ul><li><em>Street Lag:</em> Wall Street notices companies after they have had a significant boost in prices thus missing out on the majority of return.</li><li><em>Inspected by 4:</em> If the fund managers buys an unknown stock and it does down, blame comes on the fund manager but if he bought IBM, blame shifts to the market. Also, too many people to convince to buy a single stock.</li><li><em>Oysters Rockeefeller:</em> Many funds can't buy a stock not in the prescribed list. Also, it is easier to get returns on small funds than larger ones.</li><li><em>Going it alone:</em> Don't invest like an institution because you can then focus on long term growth than quarterly results.</li></ul><h2 id=3-is-this-gambling-or-what>3. Is this gambling or what?</h2><ul><li>Nothing went wrong with bonds</li><li>Fluctuations in long term bonds which depend on interest rates are as fluctuating as stock markets.</li><li>Equities have always outperformed bonds.</li><li>Ten baggers in debts aren't possible unless one invests in distressed debt.</li><li>There is no way to separate investing from gambling into those categories that are meant to reassure us.</li></ul><h2 id=4-passing-the-mirror-test>4. Passing the Mirror Test</h2><p>Ask yourself these questions before investing in stocks:</p><ul><li><em>Do I have a house?</em> A house is a good first investment which of the people do. It is also difficult to loose money in this.</li><li><em>Do I need the money?</em> Only invest what you could afford to loose without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the forseeable future.</li><li><em>Do I have the personal qualities it takes to success?</em><ul><li>Patience</li><li>Self Reliance</li><li>Common Sense</li><li>A tolerance for pain</li><li>Open mindedness</li><li>Detachment</li><li>Persistence</li><li>Humility</li><li>Flexibility</li><li>A wilingness to do independant research</li><li>An ability to ignore general panic</li><li>You need to be able to resist your human nature and your &quot;gut feeling&quot;</li><li>When it comes to predicting the market, the important skill here isn't listening, but instead it's snoring.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=5-is-this-a-good-market-please-don-t-ask>5. Is this a good market? Please don't ask</h2><ul><li>Talking about good markets, bad market, bull/bear phases is futile.</li><li><em>Penultimate Preparedness:</em> We always keep preparing ourselves for the last thing that's happened, as opposed to what's going to happen next. The next time isn't like the last time.</li><li><em>The Cocktail Theory:</em><ul><li>When ten people would rather talk to a dentist about plaque than to the manager of an equity mutual fund about stocks, it's likely that the market is going to turn up.</li><li>In stage two, after Peter confesses what he does for a living, the new acquaintances linger a bit longer - perhaps to tell Peter about how risky stock market is before they talk to the dentist. The market is 15% up.</li><li>In stage three, with the market 30% up from stage 1, a crowd of interested parties ignores the dentist and circles around Peter all evening.</li><li>In stage four, crowd starts telling Peter what to buy. This is a sign that market has reached a top.</li><li>As Warren Buffet says, &quot;The stock market is only a reference to see if anybody is offering to do anything foolish.&quot;</li></ul></li></ul><p>Things to remember from this section:</p><ul><li>Don't overestimate the skills and wisdom of professionals.</li><li>Take advantage of what you already know</li><li>Look for opportunities that haven't been discovered and certified by Wall Street companies that are &quot;off the radar scope&quot;.</li><li>Invest in a house before you invest in a stock.</li><li>Invest in companies, not in the stock market.</li><li>Ignore short term fluctuations.</li><li>Large profits can be made in common stocks.</li><li>Large losses can be made in common stocks.</li><li>Predicting the economy is futile.</li><li>Predicting the short-term direction of the stock market is futile.</li><li>The long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and also far superior to the long term returns from bonds.</li><li>Keeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an endless stud-poker hand.</li><li>Common stocks aren't for everyone, nor even for all phases of a persons' life.</li><li>The average person is exposed to interesting local companies and products years before the professionals.</li><li>Having an edge will help you make money in stocks.</li><li>In the stock market, one in hand is worth ten in the bush.</li></ul><h1 id=part-ii-picking-winners>Part II: Picking Winners</h1><h2 id=6-stalking-the-tenbagger>6.
