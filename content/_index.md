I am the founder of [Nirah](https://nirah.app), a company
that helps technology companies deliver and process real-time webhooks
securely and reliably.


Webhooks are HTTP requests
sent by a server which needs to communicate about a state change for e.g
GitHub needs to communicate to CI/CD servers if a new commit is pushed,
or Stripe needs to communicate if any payment was made, etc.
Webhooks make pooling redundant i.e. one server doesn't need to keep
asking the other server if they have any information which is valuable
for them, instead the flow would be that the other server will notify
every server who is supposed to keep listening about information.

I help technology companies which utilize event-driven
architectures so that engineering teams can focus on building
their core competitive advantage and outsource webhooks parts to Nirah.
The long-term mission for Nirah is to make server-to-server communications
better and would approach that mission one product at a time.

I have built the
[Reverse Penny Drop](https://docs.setu.co/data/bav/reverse-penny-drop/quickstart)
product for Setu which can fetch account number and
IFSC by making a refundable Rs. 1 payment using UPI, helped it find
product-market fit by talking to users to understand their workflows
and pain points, and made it the highest margin product of Setu.

I have built the [chatbot](https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us) for handling
customer support tickets to help
Carousell transition from Zendesk and thus implement custom journeys
as required by business and also enable significant cost savings.
It has 50,000 daily users.
