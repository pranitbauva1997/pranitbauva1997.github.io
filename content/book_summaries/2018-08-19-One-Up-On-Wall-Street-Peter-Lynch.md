A great book which I read in Summers '18 and have started applying his
principles in investing in businesses by owning stocks of public companies.

## Introduction: The advantages of dumb money

 - Analysts miss ten baggers but normal people can see the companies
   selling goods around them.
 - The power of common knowledge: We can understand how consumer react to
   the products of companies because we & our friends have bought them.
 - Invest only in companies which you understand. Don't invest in
   microcontrollers if you can't understand product specifications.
 - Understand consumer behaviour but also read financial statements.

# Part I:  Preparing to Invest

## 1. The Making of a Stockpicker

 - No such things as a hereditary knack for picking stocks.
 - Playing golf is great because it gives you access to people who have
   resources.
 - Studying courses like history, psychology, political science,
   metaphysics, epistemology, logic, religion & philosophy can be
   extremely helpful if put to good use.
 - Markets aren't really efficient and anyone can beat the market with a
   disciplined approach to investing.

## 2. The Wall Street Oxymorons

Problems of Wall Street Professionals:

 - *Street Lag:* Wall Street notices companies after they have had a
   significant boost in prices thus missing out on the majority of return.
 - *Inspected by 4:* If the fund managers buys an unknown stock and it
   does down, blame comes on the fund manager but if he bought IBM, blame
   shifts to the market. Also, too many people to convince to buy a
   single stock.
 - *Oysters Rockeefeller:* Many funds can't buy a stock not in the
   prescribed list. Also, it is easier to get returns on small funds than
   larger ones.
 - *Going it alone:* Don't invest like an institution because you can then
   focus on long term growth than quarterly results.

## 3. Is this gambling or what?

 - Nothing went wrong with bonds
 - Fluctuations in long term bonds which depend on interest rates are as
   fluctuating as stock markets.
 - Equities have always outperformed bonds.
 - Ten baggers in debts aren't possible unless one invests in distressed
   debt.
 - There is no way to separate investing from gambling into those
   categories that are meant to reassure us.

## 4. Passing the Mirror Test

Ask yourself these questions before investing in stocks:

 - *Do I have a house?* A house is a good first investment which of the
   people do. It is also difficult to loose money in this.
 - *Do I need the money?* Only invest what you could afford to loose
   without that loss having any effect on your daily life in the
   forseeable future.
 - *Do I have the personal qualities it takes to success?*
    - Patience
    - Self Reliance
    - Common Sense
    - A tolerance for pain
    - Open mindedness
    - Detachment
    - Persistence
    - Humility
    - Flexibility
    - A wilingness to do independant research
    - An ability to ignore general panic
    - You need to be able to resist your human nature and your "gut feeling"
    - When it comes to predicting the market, the important skill here
      isn't listening, but instead it's snoring.

## 5. Is this a good market? Please don't ask

 - Talking about good markets, bad market, bull/bear phases is futile.
 - *Penultimate Preparedness:* We always keep preparing ourselves for the
   last thing that's happened, as opposed to what's going to happen next.
   The next time isn't like the last time.
 - *The Cocktail Theory:*
    - When ten people would rather talk to a dentist about plaque than to
      the manager of an equity mutual fund about stocks, it's likely that
      the market is going to turn up.
    - In stage two, after Peter confesses what he does for a living, the
      new acquaintances linger a bit longer - perhaps to tell Peter about
      how risky stock market is before they talk to the dentist. The
      market is 15% up.
    - In stage three, with the market 30% up from stage 1, a crowd of
      interested parties ignores the dentist and circles around Peter all
      evening.
    - In stage four, crowd starts telling Peter what to buy. This is a sign
      that market has reached a top.
    - As Warren Buffet says, "The stock market is only a reference to see
      if anybody is offering to do anything foolish."

Things to remember from this section:

 - Don't overestimate the skills and wisdom of professionals.
 - Take advantage of what you already know
 - Look for opportunities that haven't been discovered and certified by
   Wall Street companies that are "off the radar scope".
 - Invest in a house before you invest in a stock.
 - Invest in companies, not in the stock market.
 - Ignore short term fluctuations.
 - Large profits can be made in common stocks.
 - Large losses can be made in common stocks.
 - Predicting the economy is futile.
 - Predicting the short-term direction of the stock market is futile.
 - The long-term returns from stocks are both relatively predictable and
   also far superior to the long term returns from bonds.
 - Keeping up with a company in which you own stock is like playing an
   endless stud-poker hand.
 - Common stocks aren't for everyone, nor even for all phases of a persons'
   life.
 - The average person is exposed to interesting local companies and
   products years before the professionals.
 - Having an edge will help you make money in stocks.
 - In the stock market, one in hand is worth ten in the bush.

# Part II: Picking Winners

## 6. Stalking the tenbagger

 - Try to find stocks in products of everyday companies
 - Try to find the industry where you work or know about in detail.

## 7. I've Got it, I've Got it - What is it?

 - Treat the company you saw at the mall as an anonymous tip and do your
   own thorough analysis
 - Big companies move small while small companies move big.

### The Six Categories:

 - **The Slow Growers**:
    - Large & aging companies
    - High dividend because no place else to invest money
 - **The Stalwarts**:
    - Have economic "moats"
    - Big companies
    - Better returns than cash
    - Doesn't fall in value easily even if grossly overprices
 - **The Fast Growers**:
    - Small, aggressive high growth companies
    - Doesn't necessarily have to belong to fast-growing industry
    - Plenty of risk since companies are over-zealous and underfinanced
    - Once they turn to slow growers, the stock gets beaten.
    - Look out for good balance sheets and making substantial profits.
    - Figuring out when they'll stop growing, and how much to pay for
      growth is tricky and non-trivial.
 - **The Cyclicals**:
    - Profits rise and fall in regular but not completely predictable
      fashion.
    - Autos, airlines, tire companies, steel companies, chemical companies
      and even defense companies.
    - Flourish in expanding economies (more than stalwarts) while if it
      goes in the other direction, it is east to loose a lot.
 - **The Turnarounds**:
    - Battered & depressed
    - No growers
    - But they make up lost ground very quickly
 - **The Asset Plays**:
    - Companies sitting on something valuable like cash or real estate.
    - It can also be loyal subscribers who pay monthly.

*Highfliers to Low Riders:* Companies don't stay in the same category
forever.

Exit the position in accordance to the stock category it belongs to.

## 8. The Perfect Stock, What a Deal!

 - It sounds dull or even better ridiculous
 - It does something dull
 - It's a spinoff
 - The institutions don't own it, and the analysts don't follow it
 - The rumors around: It's involved with toxic waste and/or the mafia
 - There is somethign depressing about it
 - It's a no-growth industry
 - It's got a niche
 - People have to keep buying it
 - It is a user of technology
 - The insiders are buying it
 - The company is buying back its shares

## 9. Stocks - I'd avoid

 - If you aren't clever at selling hot stocks (and the fact that you have
   bought them is a due that you won't be), you would soon see your profits
   turn to loss.
 - High growth & hot industries attract a very smart crowd that wants to
   get into business. Entrepreneurs and venture capitalists stay awake
   nights trying to figure out how to get into the act as quickly as
   possible.
 - Beware of the next something
 - Avoid companies who prefer to blow money on foolish acquisitions.
 - Beware the whisper stock
 - Beware the middleman companies whose major sales come from a single
   entity.
 - Beware the stock with the exciting name

## 10. Earnings, Earning, Earnings

 - People who work in secure jobs that pay low salaries and modest raises
   are slow growers, the human equivalent of the electric utilities.
 - People who command good salaries and get predictable raises, such as
   middle-level managers of corporations are stalwarts.
 - Farmers, hotel and resort employees, summer camp operator who make money
   in short bursts are cyclicals.
 - Those who live off family fortunes but contribute nothing from their
   own labor are asset plays.
 - Guttersnipes, drifters, down-and-outers, bankrupts, workers who've
   been laid off, and others in the unemployment lines are all potential
   turnarounds, as long as there's any energy left in them.
 - Actors, inventors, real estate develoeprs, small businessmen, athletes,
   musicials are all potential fast growers but also extremely risky.
 - P/E low for slow growers and high for fast growers.
 - Avoid stocks with excessively high P/E ratios
 - When you find that a few stocks are selling at inflated prices, it's
   likely that most stocks are selling at inflated prices.
 - Investors pay more for stocks when interest rates are low.
 - Don't try to predict earnings
 - Figure out how the company plans to increase it's earnings.
 - The five basic ways are: reduce costs, raise prices, expand into new
   markets, sell more of its product in the old markets, or revitalize,
   close or otherwise dispose off a losing operation.

## 11. The Two Minute Drill

 - Give a two minute monologue that covers the reason why you are
   interested in a particular stock.
 - The mistake Peter did when he bought Buildner's was that he assumed
   that he cloning this model would work everywhere which didn't turn
   out to be true.

## 12. Getting the facts

 - Try to get the most out of your broker especially if you are using a
   full service brokerage firm.
 - *Calling the company*:
    - Investors relations are often helpful and provide a good info only
      if you know how to ask.
     - Ignore the marketing bullshit and focus on the actual business.
 - Visit the headquarters
 - Visit investors relations in person

## 13. Some Famous Numbers

 - Percent of sales
 - The P/E ratio
 - The cash position
 - The debt factor
 - Dividend
 - Book value (extremely tricky)
 - more hidden assets like inventory, real estate subsidiaries, tax breaks,
   etc.
 - Cashflows
 - Pension Plans
 - Earning growth

## 14. Rechecking the Story

 - Three stages: start-up phase (riskiest), rapid expansion phase (most
   money is made), mature/saturation phase (where company struggles to
   increase earnings).
 - One has to always be on it's toes and keep rechecking the company.

## 15. The Final Checklist

#### Stocks in general:
 - P/E ratio, its relative value in the industry
 - % of institutional ownership (the lower the better)
 - Whether insiders are buying & the company itself buying back its own
   shares. Both +ve.
 - Growth & consistency of earnings (except for asset play)
 - Whether a strong balance sheet (debt to equity ratio)
 - The cash position

#### Slow Growers:

 - If bought for dividends, check for consistency and growth.
 - % of earnings as dividends

#### Stalwarts:

 - Big companies which wouldn't go out of business
 - But check for P/E ratio
 - Possible diworseifications that may reduce earnings
 - Check the company's long term growth rate
 - Check how the company has fared during previous recessions

#### Cyclicals:

 - Keep a close watch on inventories and supply demand relationship.
 - Anticipate a shrinking P/E multiple over time as business recovers and
   investors look ahead to the end of the cycle when peak earnings are
   achieved.
 - If you know the cyclical, you have an advantage in figuring out the
   cycles.

#### Fast Growers:

 - Verify whether the fast growing business is a major part of the company's
   business.
 - Growth rate in earnings
 - Company has duplicated its success in multiple locations.
 - Company still has room to grow
 - Whether the expansion is speeding up or slowing down.
 - Few institutions & only handful of analysts cover the stock.

#### Turnarounds:

 - Can the company survive a raid by its creditors? How much cash the
   company has? How much debt? What is the debt structure?
 - If bankrupt, what's left for the shareholders?
 - How is the company supposed to be turning around? How it rid itself of
   unprofitable divisions?
 - Is business coming back?
 - Are costs being cut?

#### Asset Plays:

 - What's the value of the assets? Are there are any hidden assets?
 - How much debt is there to detract from these assets?
 - Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?
 - Is there a raider in the wings to help shareholder reap the benefits of
   these assets?

Some more pointers from this section?

 - Understand the nature of the companies you own and the specific relations
   for holding the stock.
 - By putting your stock into categories, you'll have a better idea of
   what to expect from them
 - Big companies have small moves and small companies have big moves.
 - Consider the size, if you expect to profit from a product.
 - Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven
   that their concept can be replicated.
 - Be suspicious of copmanies with growth rates of 50% to 100% a year.
 - Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.
 - Distrust diworseifications
 - Long shots almost never pay off
 - It's better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a
   company's plans are working out.
 - People get incredibly valuable information from their jobs that may not
   reach the professionals.
 - Separate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very
   smart, very rich and his or her last tip went up.
 - Some stock tips from experts in the field may turn out to be valuable.
 - Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favour,
   and haven't caught the fancy of Wall Street.
 - Moderately fast growers (20-30%) in non-growth industries are ideal
   investments.
 - Look for companies with niches.
 - When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the
   ones with superior financial conditions.
 - Companies that have no debt can't go bankrupt.
 - Managerial ability may be important, but it's quite difficult to assess.
 - A lot of money can be made when a troubled company turns around.
 - Carefully consider P/E ratio. If overprices, it's difficult to make money.
 - Find a story line to follow as a way of monitoring company's progress.
 - Look for companies that consistently buy back shares.
 - Study the dividend record for consistency & growth.
 - Look for companies with little or no institutional ownership.
 - Favour companies in which management has a significant personal
   investment.
 - Insider buying is a positive sign.
 - Devote an hour a week to do investment research.
 - Be patient. Watched stock never boils.
 - Buying stocks purely on book value is dangerous.

# Part III

## 16. Designing a Portfolio

 - If you have high expectations you will more likely get frustrated at
   stocks for defying you, and you may become impatient. Or worse, you
   may take unnecessary risks in the pursuit of illusory payoffs.
 - The only way to maximize long-term gains is to stick to a strategy
   through good and bad years.
 - How many stocks is too many? Don't rely on any fixed number of stocks
   but rather judge on a case by case basis.
 - If looking for a ten bagger, more stocks you own, better it is.
 - Spreading your money among several categories of stocks is another
   way to minimize downside risk.
 - Categorizing:
    - *Slow growers*: Low risk, low gain
    - *Stalwarts*: Low risk, moderate gain
    - *Asset Plays*: low risk, high gain
    - *Cyclicals* may be low risk & high gain or high risk and low gain
      depending on investor's ability at understanding cycles.
    - *Fast Growers*: high risk, high gain

 - Check company stories regularly, not prices.
 - Rotate in & out of stocks depending on what has happened to the price
   as it relates to the story.

## 18. The Twelve Silliest (and most dangerous) things people say about stock prices

 - It has gone down this much already, it can't go much lower
 - If it's gone this high already, how can it possibly go higher?
 - It's only $3 a share, what can I loose?
 - Eventually they always come back
 - It's always the darkest before the dawn
 - When it rebounds to $10, I'll sell.
 - What me worry? Conservative stocks don't fluctuate much.
 - It's taking too long for anything to happen.
 - Look at all the money I've lost: I didn't buy it
 - I missed that one, I'll catch the next one.
 - The stock's gone up, so I must be right or the stock's gone down so I
   must be wrong.
